What I'm doing as of **Tuesday, April  23, 2022**

-   Looking for the next phase of my career. Ideas welcome :).
-   Reading [No One Is Talking About This by Patricia Lockwood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53733106-no-one-is-talking-about-this)

(Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs) for the idea of [keeping a /now page](https://nownownow.com/about) like this one.)
