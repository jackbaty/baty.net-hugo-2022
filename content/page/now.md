What I'm doing as of **Friday, July 29, 2022**

- Looking for the next phase of my career. Ideas welcome :).
- Reading [Stolen Focus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus) by Johann Hari. (But I've been too distracted to make much progress, ha!)
- Learning to maintain a salt-water reef tank.

(Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs) for the idea of [keeping a /now page](https://nownownow.com/about) like this one.)
