## What’s a “Life Stack”?

This is my “Life Stack”. I used to call it “Stuff I Use” but thought “Life Stack” sounded cooler. Either way, it’s a list of things that I use to manage my life or that I simply enjoy using.

Last updated **July 2022.**

## Computing

*   **Apple MacBook Pro M1 Max (2022)** – Finally, Apple makes a great laptop again.
*   **Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2015)** – I tinker with Linux on this. Hate the trackpad more than anything.
*   **Apple iPad Pro 10.9 (2021)** – I am not an iPad person. Not sure I ever will be but this is a great device anyway. The Magic Keyboard makes it usable.
*   **iPhone 12 Mini** – It’s an iPhone. The properly sized one. I put it in the Computing category but it goes in nearly every category.
*   **LG 32-inch 4K display** – It’s fine. I think I’d prefer something smaller, but 5K.
*   [**Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2**](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb) – The greatest keyboard. It’s nearly perfect.

## Software

Here’s the software that I currently use on a regular basis.

*   **[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)**,  **[Org mode](https://orgmode.org/)**, and [**Org-roam**](https://www.orgroam.com/) – I write nearly everything in Org-mode. Tasks, lists, documents, publishing, all in plain text.
*   [**DEVONthink**](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html) – Email Archives, Manuals, PDFs, Scanned documents. Years of archives remain searchable and synced across devices.
*   **Apple Mail** – It’s fine, and it’s always right there.
*   **BBEdit** – As much as I try to remain in Emacs for editing, whenever I need something fancy done with a lot of text, I turn to BBEdit. It’s the editor I’ve used the longest. In fact, it may be the piece of software I’ve used the longest, period. It remains truly great.
*   [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/) – I have no real need for LaTeX but it does such a great job laying out documents that I use it anyway. Mostly, this is done via Org mode but I also use LaTeX directly when I feel like being tweaky.
*   **Terminal** – I spend a lot of time in a terminal. Apple’s built-in Terminal app works fine for me, now that I’m using [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/).
*   [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) – People enjoy hating on Slack but it really is a wonderful replacement for the tangle of emails and reply-all threads that came before.
*   [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) – For a long time I pushed Mercurial over Git, as it was simpler to use and understand. I lost, so everything goes in Git. 
*   [**1Password**](https://1password.com/) – Password management
*   [**Chronosync**](https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html) – Helps me keep things backed up properly
*   **[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)** – Launcher and generally useful utility for all sorts of automation and shortcuts. Replaced Alfred for me a year or so ago.
*   [**Keyboard Maestro**](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) – Macro wizardry. A wildly useful tool for automating things. I’ve also started using it as my text snippet expander and it works great for that, too.
*   **[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)** — Far and away the best screenshot utility
*   **Apple Messages** – Nearly everyone I communicate with uses Apple devices
*   [**Signal**](https://signal.org/) – For non-Apple and/or private communication

## Photography

### Software

*   [**Lightroom**](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) – I use the Classic version.
*   [**Capture One Pro**](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx) – Raw file editor. 
*   **Apple Photos** – For iPhone shots and keepers exported from Capture One
*   Photo Mechanic – Ingesting, tagging, and renaming photos from cards. Nothing is faster or easier. I’d like to not need it, but trying to caption and tag dozens of photos at a time is an exercise in frustration in any other app.
*   [**DxO PhotoLab**](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/) – Unbelievably good noise reduction with great camera/lens profiles.
*   [**SilverFast**](http://www.silverfast.com/) – Scanning software for the Epson. I can’t tell you how much I hate it, but it gets me the best results.

### Cameras

I love cameras. Most of mine are film cameras. Here’s what I’m using currently.

**Leica M10-R**

![](https://baty.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/R0002287-1024x683.jpg)

Leica M10-R

The Leica M10-R is a dream camera. Paired with the fabulous 50mm Summilux-M ASPH or the 35mm Summilux-M ASPH FLE, I am wanting nothing.

**Hasselblad 500C/M**

![](https://baty.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/hasselblad500cm.jpg)

Hasselblad 500C/M

Medium format film cameras. Some cameras are iconic for a reason. The Hasselblad V series cameras are iconic, beautiful, and superbly engineered. They also produce wonderful images, which is why they are my favorite all-around cameras.

**Leica M Film Cameras**

I’m a rangefinder guy.

Leica MP

**Linhof Master Technika**

![](https://baty.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/linhof-819x1024.jpg)

Linhof Master Technika

Large Format (4×5) film camera. I love this thing. It’s built like a tank and smooth as silk. It’s also a pain in the ass to use, but there’s nothing like a 4×5 negative.

**Other Cameras**

I love cameras. Here’s a list of the ones I currently own but don’t use as often.

*   **Graflex Crown Graphic** – 4×5 film camera
*   **Graflex Speed Graphic** – Another 4×5 film camera
*   **Canon AE–1 Program** – 35mm Film SLR (My first real camera)
*   **Canon Canonet** – 35mm rangefinder camera
*   **Canon Pro-zoom 814 Electronic** – Super8 movie film camera
*   **Leica IIIf** – Barnack!
*   **Minolta Autocord** – Medium format TLR
*   **Nikon F100** – 35mm auto-focus film camera
*   **Olympus OM–1n** – 35mm film camera
*   **Olympus OM–2n** – 35mm film camera
*   **Olympus Stylus Epic** – Compact 35mm film camera

### Photo Hardware

Some miscellaneous photo-related support items

*   **Canon PRO–100** – Photo printer that I too rarely use
*   **Epson V750** – Flatbed film scanner. Works great for medium and large format. Less great for 35mm. After 12 years, it’s broken.
*   **PrimeFilm XAs** – 35mm film scanner. I hate using it.
*   [**Profoto D1 Monolights**](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/661871-REG/Profoto_901056_D1_Air_500Ws_2_Monolight.html) – I’m fortunate enough to own a couple of great monolights. I should use them more often.
*   **[Billingham Hadley Pro Small](https://billingham.com/products/hadley-small-pro-camera-bag_colour-sage-fibrenyte-chocolate-leather)** – Beautiful and well-made camera bag

### Darkroom

![](https://i0.wp.com/baty.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/focomatv35-820x1024.jpg?ssl=1)

![](https://i0.wp.com/baty.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2017-Roll-008_09_Focomat-IIc-1003x1024.jpg?ssl=1)

I use a bathroom as a makeshift darkroom.

*   [**Leitz Focomat v35**](http://www.bonavolta.ch/hobby/en/photo/v35.htm) – 35mm auto-focus enlarger. Solid and reliable. It cost as much as a Volkswagon when it was first produced in 1979. It is a fantastic device.
*   [**Beseler 45MXT**](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/3991-REG/Beseler_8227_45MXT_Enlarger_Chassis_Only.html) – This is for printing medium and large format negatives. Mine is a little janky but works great overall.
*   **[Leitz Focomat IIc](https://www.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/Focomat_IIc)** – Manufactured from 1956–1983, the Focomat IIc is a giant, over-engineered marvel of an enlarger. I bought mine as a fixer-upper from Craigslist and I still don’t have it working completely. Getting there, though

## Lifestyle and Miscellaneous Hardware

### Music

*   [**Rega P1 Turntable**](https://www.amazon.com/REGA-Rega-RP1-Turntable-Gray/dp/B004B3GELG) – I love listening to records. I love owning my music and being able to see as well as hear it. I consider the P1 to be a terrific value. Audio people call it a “budget” turntable but I prefer to think of it as a cheap, “high-end” turntable. I’ve used it nearly every day for almost a decade.
*   [**Rega Brio 3 Integrated Amplifier**](https://www.stereophile.com/content/rega-brio-integrated-amplifier-rega-brio-3-march-2007) – Purchased in 2010 to go with P1. It has a good phono stage and still sounds great. I don’t feel a need to replace it.
*   **[Bluesound Node](https://www.bluesound.com/products/node/)** – Hi-Res music streamer
*   [**Roon Optimized Core Kit / NUC**](https://kb.roonlabs.com/Roon_Optimized_Core_Kit) – This is my new favorite thing. It’s a tiny computer running the [Roon music software](https://roonlabs.com/) and it’s the best way I’ve ever had to listen to, organize, and discover music.

And the rest…

*   **Focal Chorus V Speakers** – Pretty good floor-standing speakers in my TV/Music room.
*   **[KEF LSX](https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/kef-lsx)** – Outstanding wireless speakers
*   **Yamaha CD-S300BL CD Player** – I still listen to CDs, so I bought a new CD player a few years ago.
*   **[Sonos wireless music system](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home)** – Music everywhere in my house. I use a Soundbar and several Play:3 speakers.
*   **[Sennheiser HD 600](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Open-Back-Professional-Headphone/dp/B00004SY4H)** – Open-back, over-the-ear headphones. These are for when I want to really _listen_ to music.
*   **Apple AirPods Max** – They’re [amazing but I kind of hate them](https://baty.net/2022/airpods-max-are-amazing-but-i-kind-of-hate-them/)
*   **Apple HomePods** – I ended up with a couple of these. They look and sound very good.

### Other

*   **Amazon Kindle Oasis** (2nd gen) – Books on the go. I prefer real books but the Kindle sure is handy. I like the larger size of this model.
*   **Kobe Forma** ebook reader – An alternative to Amazon that works great with more formats and I can rent books from my local library right from the device.

## Pen and Paper

*   [**Leuchtturm 1917 Notebooks**](https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Size-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4/) – Better than a Moleskine and perfect for use as a Bullet Journal.
*   [**Hobonichi Techo Planner**](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2018/pc/detail_cover/pb18_jan.html) – Best little day planner ever. I’ve carried one for many years. I sometimes use them only sporadically, but I always come back.
*   [**Field Notes**](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) – Always have a Field Notes notebook in my back pocket. It’s a better capture tool than the iPhone
*   [**Pilot Custom 823**](https://baty.net/2021/pilot-custom-823-fountain-pen/) – My everyday fountain pen. It’s nearly perfect
*   [**Pelikan Souveran M400**](https://www.amazon.com/Pelikan-Souveran-M400-Black-Fountain/dp/B002MT02DM/) – Beautiful, classic fountain pen. I had the nib tweaked by Richard Binder and it writes like butter. It’s for fancy writing.
*   **[Mitsu-Bishi Hi-Uni Pencils](https://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Hi-Uni-Pencils/ct/621)** – I’ve come around on pencils recently. I find myself reaching for a pencil as often as a pen. More so, maybe.
*   [**Caran D’ache Pencil Sharpening Machine**](https://www.amazon.com/Caran-Dache-Pencil-sharpening-Machine-455-200/dp/B0013F5R0Y/) – Overkill, but I love it.
*   [**Olympia SM3 Typewriter**](https://typewriterreview.com/2013/02/28/olympia-sm3/) – My favorite typewriter
*   [**Olympia SM9 Typewriter**](https://archive.baty.net/2014/olympia-sm9/) – My second favorite typewriter

## Every Day Carry

*   [**Tag Heuer Aquaracer Automatic watch**](https://www.tagheuer.com/en-us/watches/aquaracer-calibre-5-automatic-watch-43-mm-way2010-ba0927) – No batteries, beautiful, and good to 300 meters in the water – because that’s handy right?
*   **Apple Watch (Series 7)** – The health stuff and proper notifications are handy. I wish I could wear this _and_ the Tag.
*   [**Goruck GR1 backpack**](https://www.goruck.com/GR1) – If I ever go outside I’m ready.
*   [**Benchmade Mini Griptilian AXIS Lock Knife**](https://www.amazon.com/Benchmade-Mini-Griptilian-Knife-Drop-Point/dp/B06XKRZX76) – Always in my pocket. I never realized how handy a pocket knife could be until I started carrying one everywhere.
*   [**Bellroy Note Sleeve Wallet**](https://bellroy.com/products/note-sleeve-wallet/leather/teal#image-0) – Feels great, works great.
*   [**Bellroy Field Notes Notebook Cover**](https://bellroy.com/products/field-notes-notebook-cover-mini/leather/charcoal#image-1) – A great way to carry my ever-present Field Notes notebook.
*   [**Blunt Classic Umbrella**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M3E26F8/) – Who knew a good umbrella would make such a big difference? This is a very nice one.
*   [**Filson original Briefcase**](https://www.filson.com/original-briefcase-1.html) – I’ve owned a number of bags and this one is the one I’ve settled on. Well-designed, simple, and very well-made.

Whew! That’s a lot of stuff.
