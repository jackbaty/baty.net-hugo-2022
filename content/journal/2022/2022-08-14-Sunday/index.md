Today's photo is of the [hammer coral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphyllia_ancora) I just added to the aquarium. It looks super cool under the blue "moon" lighting.

COVID Day 3. Cold symptoms about the same. Headache worse. Also, my eyes feel like they're going to pop out of my head.

I'm slowly coming around to the idea that living in Doom Emacs is a mistake. It occurred to me that I don't even know how to load a package or change a keybinding in "normal" Emacs. I only know Doom's wrappers for those functions. This is not good.
