I'm bored with all of this.

So basically [Curio](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/) now has a form of <mark>transclusion for figures</mark>. That, and file-backed text figures make Curio a sort of visual Roam. [Curio 22 Release Notes](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/releasenotes/?v=22)

As an org-mode user, I'm starting to feel isolated. If I don't want to use Emacs or (sort of) Logseq, my "text" files aren't very useful. It makes me <mark>miss Markdown a little</mark>.

[Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) is clever and helps me stay in Emacs, but it's <mark>not as easy or immediately useful</mark> as the more fluid and visual tools like Roam or [Logseq](https://logseq.com). I don't know what to do about this, other than to not use Emacs for my PKM or whatever.

[Nota - Pro notes app designed for local Markdown files.](https://nota.md/) Looks and feels quite nice and has an actual Mac menu bar like all Mac-assed apps should. Missing daily notes, though.
