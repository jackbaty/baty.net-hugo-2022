[Center Window on the Current Monitor in Emacs, Simplified â€¢ Christian Tietze](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/04/emacs-center-window-current-monitor-simplified/) _Very_ simplified. Nice.

I spent nearly 4 hours yesterday <mark>cleaning up old content</mark> here. Mostly bad image links due to trying to migrate from a half-dozen different WordPress gallery plugins. I think I got most of them. What a pain. Now I remember why I keep promising myself I won't change platforms, again.

This is handy, and comes with SetApp: [TextSniper - Capture and extract any text from your Mac's screen | images](https://textsniper.app/?ref=christiantietze)

D'ya ever feel like you <mark>need a reboot</mark>? I feel like I need a reboot.

Shot a roll of the new Neopan Acros in the Nikon F100 yesterday. Something doesn't seem right, but I can't put my finger on it (other than the scratches and dust).

Looking at photos on tiny screens sure papers over a lot of flaws.

Film photo reaction: "Oooh, it's almost in focus, there's not too much motion blur, the grain isn't too rough, and there's only a few dust spots...I love it!"
Digital photo reaction: "It's not perfect, delete it."
