ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome to December!

I had [my first real AI moment](/2022/my-first-real-ai-moment) this morning.

It's nice to see [Kottke is back](https://kottke.org/22/11/hi-hello-im-back-at-it).

Speaking of wild new software capabilities, [Rewind.ai](https://rewind.ai) just enabled live Zoom transcriptions:

> Now you can search across any words spoken during Zoom meetings. It also works in realtime: if you get
> called on and want to reference what was just being said, just rewind to see the transcript.

There are times I grow weary of using Emacs (and _any_ plain text) and start looking at prettier, pointy-clickier alternatives. This is dumb, because Emacs and Org-mode are so completely flexible and powerful that everything else pales in comparison. The novelty soon wears off and I'm back home in Emacs.
