I haven't felt like working hard enough to write complete blog posts recently, so I did the obvious thing and dusted off my old newsletter. It's still called "The Lathe" and it's running on a self-hosted Ghost instance at [RudimentaryLathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org). How's that for doing the opposite of what I should?
