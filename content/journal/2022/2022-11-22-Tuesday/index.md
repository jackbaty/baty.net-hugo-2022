If Leica can [re-introduce the M6](https://leica-camera.com/en-US/photography/cameras/m/m6) from 20 years ago, maybe Ricoh will show up with a new GR1v. I'd shit my pants for joy.

Social media has become exhausting for me. Even Mastodon is annoying now that everyone feels the need to tell everyone else how they're supposed to _be_ on the platform. It's all either that or bitching or snickering. I doubt I'll do anything about it, though.

Come to think of it, what I want isn't so much "social" media but rather a place where I can talk about myself in public ðŸ˜†. And I already have several of those places. They're called "blogs".
