As much as I like what [Hey email](https://hey.com) is doing, After two years with the service, I've decided to <mark>cancel my subscription</mark>.

Reminders go in Apple Reminders. <mark>Todo lists go in Org-mode</mark>.

Twenty years ago I would be so <mark>deep into AI and surrounding technologies</mark>. I'd know all the players and I'd be using it for cool new stuff and trying _everything_. I can't understand why today I simply don't care.

Whenever I'm looking at some script or utility and I see <mark>it's written in Ruby or Python</mark>, I can be pretty sure it's not going to work on my Mac.
