☀️   Clear +60°F

I never feel quite in control of the Lumix S5. Did I reset the exposure compensation? Did I return it to Auto-ISO? On the other hand, one glance at the M3 and I know everything I need to. And I can change them by feel, without menus or anything. It's calming. The Lumix kind of stresses me out.

I'd be more interested in spending time on the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) timeline if they'd implement (private) likes. As it stands, my timeline consists almost entirely of things like "@person Nice! 👏" because there's no other way to acknowledge something.

I really need to clean my (HHKB) keyboard. Need a key puller, first.
