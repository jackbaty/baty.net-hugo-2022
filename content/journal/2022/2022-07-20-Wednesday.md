“Tools for Thought” are a lie.

I made my <mark>Twitter and Instagram accounts private</mark> today.

I kind of hate WordPress, but I also think it’s the best overall solution for my blog. I’ll change my mind later, of course. Probably after losing my shit trying to live in Gutenberg all day writing this daily note. No one wants to live here.

Many thousands of dollars to buy the best cameras and lenses and I end up making tiny Instax prints.

This looks super cool: [nb · command line and local web plain text note-taking, bookmarking, archiving, and knowledge base application](https://xwmx.github.io/nb/)

I was hoping to use [MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/) for editing these journal posts, but since I have the “Journal” category hidden using the “Ultimate Category Excluder” plugin, I can’t see them in MarsEdit. Guess the plugin hides them from xmlrpc too.

I’ve, almost unintentionally, replaced Org-roam with [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote). Denote is simpler and I’m digging simple things lately.
