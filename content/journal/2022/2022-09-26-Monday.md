Every time I log in to [Rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org) and see the Ghost dashboard it annoys me. I like the post editor and theme, but overall Ghost and I don't share the same goals. Of course this has nothing to do with my lack of recent posts.

I ordered my 2023 [Hobonichi Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2023/pc/detail_cover/pb23_jan/) planner today. I'm not sure why I keep buying them, because I only use them sporadically each year. Still, I love the idea of them, so you know, just in case.

Nearly a decade of being Docker-adjacent and I still don't understand it. If I play my cards right I'll never have to.
