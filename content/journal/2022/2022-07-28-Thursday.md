I hadn't planned on doing much customization to the new theme here, but I really wanted to keep my daily journal posts, so here we are. I had to add a "journal" post type and supporting templates so that the most recent entry is displayed on the home page and the entire entry is shown rather than just the summary. Hugo templates are tricky, but I'm getting the hang of them.

I'm starting to enjoy having the Lumix S5 around. Zoom, macro, and auto-focus are handy.

After hearing rumors that Meta is going to raise the price of the Quest 2 by $100 in August, I ordered one. I'll give my dad my original Quest. Maybe we'll fish or play golf together.
