I love Leica M cameras so much, but my eyes are becoming more disagreeable to it by the month.

COVID is breathing down my neck but so far I've avoided it.

I no longer need to see black and white street photos with super-deep blacks and someone standing in or walking through a shaft of sunlight. I enjoyed the first 10,000 of them, though.

Got access to the new [Arc browser](https://thebrowser.company) today. It's different and will take a little time to get used to. It's always fun to test a new take on web browsers.
