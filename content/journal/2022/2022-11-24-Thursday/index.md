I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by social media right now. It feels crowded, somehow. I guess that's the whole point, but it's too much. I [wrote a short post about it](/2022/calm-technology/).

A lot of people are linking to [Emacs on an iPad](https://andschwa.com/posts/emacs-on-an-ipad/). There's no way I'm doing all that.

If I love plain text so much then why do I turn frickin' everything into PDFs?

Oh my, look at all these blogs! <https://ooh.directory/>

I struggle with organizing my notes because sometimes projects are a bunch of files with some notes to back them up but other times they are a bunch of notes with supporting files. The way I think of each affects how I want to organize it.
