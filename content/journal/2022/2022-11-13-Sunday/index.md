Ten years ago I lived alone and had three terrific dogs (see above). I miss the dogs, but not living alone.

I'm not really _doing_ anything lately. This doesn't always bother me, but I'm becoming disenchanted with my lack of creative output. But what to do?

I've had my fill of Mastodon 'splainers.
