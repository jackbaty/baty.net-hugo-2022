When using variable-pitched fonts in Emacs, the [Modus themes](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes) are the only themes that handle the various options correctly. For example, with `:PROPERTIES:` drawers, the start and end labels should be monospaced. Modus are the only themes I've found that do this out of the box. It's a small thing, but demonstrates the care that has gone into the themes.

I sometimes consider <mark>trading the M10-R for a (regular) Q2</mark>. I miss the convenience of auto-focus and weather sealing and simplicity offered by the Q2. I almost never change lenses on the M10-R, but I can never get over the fact that with a Q2 I _can't_ change lenses. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the 28mm focal length.
