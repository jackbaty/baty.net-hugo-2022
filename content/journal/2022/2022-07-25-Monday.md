I almost forgot I switched back to Hugo yesterday. Hi! 👋.

Sure, iPhones are capable of taking very nice photographs. This doesn't mean I want to use one myself.

For just a moment I was entertaining the idea of selling a Leica lens, the Summilux-M 35mm ASPH (FLE), to fund something else. Then I remembered my rule: "Never sell a Leica lens" because I've regretted doing so, several times. If I become desparate, fine, but otherwise, I'm keeping it.
