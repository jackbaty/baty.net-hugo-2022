I switched back to the HHKB this morning because I prefer it by a wide margin to any other keyboard I've tried.

After more than a year with the [Pilot Custom 823](https://baty.net/2021/pilot-custom-823-fountain-pen/) fountain pen, I can say that I have no need for other pens. The only time I choose a different pen is when I'm bored and feel like using something different. It lasts a day or so and I'm back to using the Pilot. It's possible that I'll never buy another fountain pen.

I've also switched back to a ruled notebook. Dot grid pages feel like the worst of both worlds.
