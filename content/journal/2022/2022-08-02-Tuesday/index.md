I've spent the morning learning how to use [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) in Emacs. It's quite different from Mu4e, but uses many of the same parts (mbsync, xapian, smtpmail, etc.). Notmuch relies almost entirely on tagging and doesn't touch my emails. This is nice because I don't fear sync issue, but is troublesome because the tags aren't reflected on the server. Still putzing with it.

Comments are back. I'm still using [Cusdis - Lightweight, privacy-first, open-source comment system](https://cusdis.com/).
