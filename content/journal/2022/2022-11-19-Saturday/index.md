I have switched back to using [Mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) for managing email in Emacs. I love how [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) searching and tagging works, but the actual email experience is better in Mu4e.

I've noticed that I remain more comfortable in more keyboard-focused apps (e.g. Emacs) when I'm using a standalone laptop rather than when docked with a big monitor. I don't know if that's because there's no mouse handy or if it's the smaller screen.
