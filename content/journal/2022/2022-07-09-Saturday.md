I think it's time for YouTubers to <mark>calm down with the production values</mark>. I never trust a video that looks too good.

One thing I've noticed when using TheBrain is the tendency to <mark>get lost in the links</mark>. I become lost in thoughts, as it were. I find this to be both a blessing and curse for someone as easily distracted as me.

Fun fact about me: <mark>I almost always cry in museums</mark>.

Someone recently added me to a Twitter list named "<mark>Miscellaneous</mark>" and nothing could be more appropriate.

I wonder who cares more about which camera was used, <mark>film people or digital people</mark>? I swear it's a draw.

Burned through a roll of <mark>HP5 with the Nikon F100</mark> and every frame is in-focus and properly exposed and now I'm mad.
