I'm now maintaining <mark>two blogs</mark> with identical content. Yes, I know it's stupid. UPDATE: No I'm not.

Installed and configured [MarsEdit 4](<https://redsweater.com/marsedit/>) but realized that if I'm going to edit posts in one place, and view them in another, I might as well use a static site. (So that's what I did. I moved it all back to Hugo this morning.) Dizzy yet? I am.

The best thing for <mark>my mental health</mark> might be to just get away from all of it.
