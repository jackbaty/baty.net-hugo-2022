I'm trying a <mark>new WordPress theme</mark> on [baty.net](https://baty.net). I was looking for something as lightweight as possible, without also being useless. I saw that [Anders Norén](https://andersnoren.se/) rewrote his Davis theme to take advantage of WordPress' new full-site editing features. It's called [Davis Blocks](https://andersnoren.se/introducing-davis-blocks/). There are a few rough edges but I like how simple it is. I'll live with it for a minute to see how it feels. I still hate editing themes in WordPress, though.

It's time to go <mark>back to work</mark>. I wish I knew what I wanted to do. Any ideas?
