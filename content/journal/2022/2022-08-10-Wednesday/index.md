Some days I want to live entirely within Emacs. Other days I'd be fine doing everything in a browser. These two modes don't get along.

I signed up for a year of [Hey.com](https://hey.com) again. I can't explain why. I think maybe I'm exhausted from spending so much energy and time recently getting [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) configured. It's been a blast, but sometimes I just want something pretty and easy.

I don't feel much like writing full-on blog posts. I still feel like typing words and publishing them, but just not in a cohesive, separate-blog-post way. I am much more into stream-of-thought posts like I'm doing here in the journal posts. It makes me think that the structure here is backwards. Maybe I should show full posts of several daily entries with a simple list of links to recent blog posts. Hmmm.

I spent way too long yesterday trying to figure out why :PROPERTIES: drawers in Org-mode were unfolded by default alluvasudden. I'm sure it's something to do with the org-fold additions in 9.6 but still can't make it stop.
