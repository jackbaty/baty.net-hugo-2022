Some days I want to live entirely within Emacs. Other days I'd be fine doing everything in a browser. These two modes don't get along.

I signed up for a year of [Hey.com](https://hey.com) again. I can't explain why. I think maybe I'm exhausted from spending so much energy and time recently getting [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) configured. It's been a blast, but sometimes I just want something pretty and easy.
