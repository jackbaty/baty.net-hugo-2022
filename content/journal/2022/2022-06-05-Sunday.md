I love "Ted Lasso" and I love Roy Kent. I also feel the same way about watching horrible things happening to people in my "entertainment". I approve of the <mark>trend of "Nice TV"</mark> that Brett is contributing to.

Asking about the "business model" is one way to signal that you don't know much about business.

What if I just closed all my browser tabs? What if I quit the browser altogether? Hell, what if I <mark>stepped away from the computer</mark> for more than 10 minutes?

And what if I <mark>stopped doing this</mark> in public all the time? Would it not be more productive and healthy to simply journal privately? Maybe I should just be quiet for a while.
