Rather than using Org-mode and ox-hugo to generate today's journal, I used Hugo's built-in command, so... `hugo new /2022/2022-07-29-Friday/index.md` ...and here we are. I don't know whether I'll continue to do this, but I do like that there's one fewer layer between what I'm typing and what shows up on the blog. I love writing Org-mode files using Emacs, but sometimes it's fun to use whichever Markdown editor I'm in the mood for. This morning, that editor is [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

Maybe I can replace Algolia for search here soon: [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) looks like just the ticket. (via [Pagefind is quite a find for site search | BryceWray.com](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/07/pagefind-quite-find-site-search/)). ****::One hour later::**** I've implemented Pagefind here. It's on the new [Search page](/searc/).
