Every week I do a water change in my aquarium. I put a record on while I drain 5 of the 30 gallons in the tank. I vacuum the rocks while siphoning. I change the filter. Then I pump in 5 gallons of fresh, homemade saltwater. It annoys the hell out of the fish and briefly upsets the corals, but it feels good and keeps the various chemical parameters in check. I love this new reef tank hobby.

This is me:

I've removed my big fat head's image from the top of the home page here. It made the layout look messy and I didn't like it.

People on every "side" have seemingly adopted their own narratives about how Twitter is doing. It's either finally a place for "Free Speech" or a hellscape riddled with nazis. It's also doomed to technical collapse any second because people were fired. Musk is a genius with a grand plan or he has no idea what he's doing and is just a rich asshole winging it while trolling the whole world. My take? Only time will tell.
