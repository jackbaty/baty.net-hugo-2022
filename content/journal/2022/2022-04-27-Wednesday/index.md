It's time for spring, why can't we have spring?

I don't see how [Nota](https://nota.md) adds anything that Obsidian doesn't already cover, other than it feels like a good Mac app. That's not trivial, though. Interesting that I can use both interchangeably. For example, I opened Obsidian and it created a daily page for me, which I'm now editing in Nota, since Nota doesn't create daily pages.

Remember [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com)? I miss Tumblr... [Jack Shares Things](https://jackbaty.tumblr.com/)

Remember [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com)? I miss my wiki...[Jack Batys Wiki — A sort of Rudimentary Lathe](http://localhost:8080/rudimentarylathe/index.html)

One of the best things I've done recently is to <mark>consolidate my domain names</mark>. Everything is under \*.baty.net now and it's a relief. On the other hand, consolidating all my sites here as one blog is something I'm less sure about.
