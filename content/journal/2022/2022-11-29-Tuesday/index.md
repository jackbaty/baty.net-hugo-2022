I'm having one of those days where I want to burn my whole process to the ground and start over. Today's thing is that I don't want to have to go "through" an app to get to my stuff. I want to be able to work directly from my Mac's finder. And I want to be able to move files around without breaking references or having them become lost to an app.

I listed [the Linhof Master Technika for sale](https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1784985/0#16106694). It's a fantastic medium format kit.
