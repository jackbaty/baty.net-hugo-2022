The concern I have about <mark>using Doom Emacs</mark> is that I'm not really learning how to use Emacs, but rather how to use Doom. But damn it's fast and improves just about every aspect of Emacs.

How do I tell Instagram to <mark>stop notifying me</mark> that "so-and-so has added to their story"? I want _some_ notifications, just not those.

I took another look at [Notion](https://notion.so) and still find it to be an overwrought mess.

I like being able to <mark>write in an outline</mark>, but I don't like being _forced_ to. Hence my disillusionment with Roam and Logseq.

Remember when I used to work here? Hell, I _owned_ the place :).

I did this: [Bringing my Daily posts here to baty.net](https://baty.net/2022/bringing-my-daily-posts-here-to-baty.net/).

There's no way I'm going to fall in love with [Warp: The terminal for the 21st century](https://www.warp.dev/), because I'm 100% sure they will be charging a subscription at some point and that the one feature I really want will be behind a paywall. Also, having to create and log into an "account" just to use my terminal makes me uncomfortable. Cool app, though.
