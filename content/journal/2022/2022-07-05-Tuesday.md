I decided not to continue my [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) subscription. It has some nice features but [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) suits me just fine, for free.

Remember when [I quit using Emacs](https://baty.net/2022/c-x-c-c/)? Now alluvasuddin I'm toying with the
idea of going with a custom config again using [Rational Emacs](https://github.com/systemcrafters/rational-emacs). Which is weird because one of the reasons I quit emacs was because I was tired of configuring things myself.
