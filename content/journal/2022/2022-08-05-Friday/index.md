Feeling the Poloaroid today. Part of me wants to order a shitload of Polaroid film, as expensive and unpredictable as it is, and just shoot.

A great thing about shooting Polaroid film is that once you've pressed the button, you're done with that photo. There's nothing left to do but grab a pen and write a caption on it, and even that's optional.

Amazon bought Roomba. I wonder if this means that I'll be able to buy a Roomba for $69 in exchange for sending Amazon a detailed map of my house.

The thing I miss most about work is when a meeting gets canceled.

Safari is flaking out on me in Ventura public beta 2.
