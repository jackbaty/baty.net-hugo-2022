I still really like what [Hey](https://www.hey.com) email is doing, but after using it with my main account again for a few days, I have to stop. It's too slow. It didn't used to be too slow, but now it's taking 3-5 seconds to switch between views and also way too long to render emails. Darn. **UPDATE:** This seems to have been a Safari issue, specifically with the Neeva extension. I've removed the extension and Hey (and other apps) are speedy again.

Only a small number of people read this site every day. I prefer it this way. There's less pressure. Lower risk. Writing here still feels like <mark>me talking to myself</mark> rather than capital-P "Publishing".

I've been shooting more digital, and <mark>more color lately</mark>. Not something I planned. It just happened.

I still believe that <mark>blockchain is mostly a horseshit</mark> tech bro fantasy, but this [thread from Vinay Gupta](https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1537602510935973888) is interesting.

I don't give a shit what you're mad at. I want to hear <mark>what you're happy about.</mark>

I'm thinking that one of the  greatest things this year is <mark>hot dog fingers</mark> scenes from EEAAO.
