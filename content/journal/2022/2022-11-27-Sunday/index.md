I took a couple of days away from social media and it was refreshing, but I'm heading back in to [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jackbaty) today. I miss people. Some of them anyway. Maybe they've stopped talking about Twitter and telling other people how to use social media? We'll see.

This morning I had either a kind of epiphany or simply a crazy thought, and that is that maybe what I need is not digital, but rather an easier/faster film camera.

Should I feel more guilty for not promoting or helping with everyone's Twitter-&gt;Mastodon migration? I love the idea of a "fediverse" and hope Mastodon is successful, but I don't feel a desire or obligation to be part of the machinery making it happen. I just want to be a participant, if that's OK.
