When I grow frustrated with indecision around my note-taking process, I often seek refuge in paper notebooks. That's not the answer either, so the carousel continues to spin.

I keep trying to enjoy using Obsidian, but I still don't like using Obsidian. I wish I understood why. I think it's simply that it doesn't feel comfortable. I don't love the way it looks or behaves. I think the availability of so many plugins is as much a hindrance to me as it is a benefit. The community is vast and great, but is also generic and focused on making the software do too much, in my opinion. This leads to eternal yak shaving, which is the opposite of what my brain needs in a note-taking tool.
