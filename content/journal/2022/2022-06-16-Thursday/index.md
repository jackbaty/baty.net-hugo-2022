I wish I were less inclined to let The Internet influence my decisions. It's not just a small influence. My <mark>entire personality can change</mark> based on the most recent blog post I've read. I change up my entire workflow because someone wrote something about doing things a different way that I've yet to try. It's crazy-making.

The battle for my <mark>private daily notes</mark> rages on. It is currently between Emacs/Org-mode and TheBrain.

I wish Apple Messages would automatically delete 2FA messages after an expiry period.

Testing [LensTagger â€“ Exiftool Lightroom Plugin](https://www.lenstagger.com/). It works pretty well, and saves me a trip to my manual exiftool scripts.

Why is it that everyone seems to want to <mark>argue over everything</mark> all the time, with everyone?

What hobby project do I need that could benifit from Redbean. I need to try this _somewhere_ [redbean 2.0 release notes](https://justine.lol/redbean2/).

It's quite fun watching the evolution of [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) in real time. Every time I do another `git pull` there's new and better things happening.
