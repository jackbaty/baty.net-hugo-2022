☀️   Clear +51°F

Shoehorning everything into Emacs in order to avoid "context switching" (as if that actually makes one more productive) is really just self-deceptive rationalization. I should know, I do it all the time.

Related: I'm not sure I can live with putting everything into Tana app. As clever as it is, it's "out there" and will probably be replaced in a year or two by something newer and shinier. It's not as pretty, and not as easy, but I'm better off staying in Emacs. Maybe one day, when I need to collaborate with others, using Tana will be feasible.

90% of the chatter around Tools For Thought is thinly-veiled rationalization for just fucking around with software.

I assume that most of the people fawning over Tana are not familiar with Tinderbox, TiddlyWiki, or Org-mode.

I let rudimentarylathe.wiki expire and regretted it so thought I'd buy it again but it seems that someone else beat me to it.

D'ya ever feel like when you put things in a wiki that you're building something&#x2013;a tool&#x2013;for the future, but when you put it on a blog instead it just gets swept way into archives and likely forgotten?

Looks like I'll need a new instance:

I keep a draft post titled "The Fediverse is a failure". Guess I should dust it off.
