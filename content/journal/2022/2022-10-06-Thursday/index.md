☀️   Clear +51°F

Shoehorning everything into Emacs in order to avoid "context switching" (as if that actually makes one more productive) is really just self-deceptive rationalization. I should know, I do it all the time.

Related: I'm not sure I can live with putting everything into Tana app. As clever as it is, it's "out there" and will probably be replaced in a year or two by something newer and shinier. It's not as pretty, and not as easy, but I'm better off staying in Emacs.
