Yesterday I asked, "[Where would you like to see daily notes?](https://baty.net/2022/where-would-you-like-to-see-daily-notes/)". I received more replies than expected (thanks!) and they overwhelmingly preferred that I keep the daily notes here at baty.net and provide access via RSS. Well OK then! Note that journal posts aren't included in the main RSS feed, but rather at [/journal/index.xml](https://baty.net/journal/index.xml). That way you can easily opt-out if you'd prefer only seeing the "real" posts.

Anyone with kids or who was once a kid remembers getting that fancy, shiny, complex, expensive new toy and _loving it_&#x2026;for a day or two. Then, it was back to sticks and cardboard boxes. I feel like this might be a metaphor for [something](https://tana.inc). ðŸ˜†

I cannot tolerate an even mildly active Discord server for more than 5 minutes. Can we go back to using forums now, please?
