Yesterday I asked, "[Where would you like to see daily notes?](https://baty.net/2022/where-would-you-like-to-see-daily-notes/)". I received more replies than expected (thanks!) and they overwhelmingly preferred that I keep the daily notes here at baty.net and provide access via RSS. Well OK then! Note that journal posts aren't included in the main RSS feed, but rather at [/journal/index.xml](https://baty.net/journal/index.xml). That way you can easily opt-out if you'd prefer only seeing the "real" posts.
