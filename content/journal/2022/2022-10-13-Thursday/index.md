Yesterday I asked, "[Where would you like to see daily notes?](https://baty.net/2022/where-would-you-like-to-see-daily-notes/)". I received more replies than expected (thanks!) and they overwhelmingly preferred that I keep the daily notes here at baty.net and provide access via RSS. Well OK then! Note that journal posts aren't included in the main RSS feed, but rather at [/journal/index.xml](https://baty.net/journal/index.xml). That way you can easily opt-out if you'd prefer only seeing the "real" posts. Or maybe I'll find a way to delay the inclusion of journals into the main RSS feed until later in the day. Still noodlin' on it. I mean, one post per day shouldn't be too noisy, right?

Anyone with kids or who was once a kid remembers getting that fancy, shiny, complex, expensive new toy and _loving it_&#x2026;for a day or two. Then, it was back to sticks and cardboard boxes. I feel like this might be a metaphor for [something](https://tana.inc). ðŸ˜†

I cannot tolerate an even mildly active Discord server for more than 5 minutes. Can we go back to using forums now, please?

I don't want to follow #trends. I just want to offer something useful to people in their actual lives. Does that make sense? I feel like it makes sense.

RSS people are my people.

I don't need more sharpness. I need more pictures.
