Am I really so creatively barren that I can't even think of interesting AI prompts?

"Intellectual Honesty" is too often a cover for cruelty.

I no longer feel comfortable using Ghost for the copingmechanism.com blog. The idea of "building an audience" or "monetizing my content" is repulsive to me, and that's all Ghost is about now. On the other hand, I'd rather not use WordPress because it's just so big and, for lack of a better word, clunky.

This is neat: Arc Browser just added "Developer Mode" when browsing websites on localhost. It adds an indicator in the sidebar and exposes a full URL bar and tools for clearing cookies/caches. I'll use this often.

I may have gotten too fancy with \`&lt;blockquote&gt;\` handling. I was automatically tweaking the display of the last paragraph, assuming it's always a citation, but it's _not_ always a citation. Let's see if I can fix it:

> This is a quote that has only a single paragraph. It should not be aligned right or in a smaller font.

<!--quoteend-->

> And this one **does** have a citation as the last paragraph, so it should be right-aligned, smaller, with a dashed prefix.

There are days I wish I'd never met Emacs because now I'm married to it and that's that, then.

I'm thinking of changing my rating system from 5-stars to 3-stars.
