I am still waffling about whether I want to run my own Mastodon instance forever. Yesterday I was all in. Today, not so much. I've kind of established myself over on [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org) and like it there just fine.

Paul Ford:

> This was the original function of the web—to transmit learned texts to those seeking them. Humans have been transmitting for millennia, of course, which is how historians are able to quote Pliny’s last tweet (“Something up w/ Vesuvius, brb”). But the seeking is important, too; people should explore, not simply feed.
