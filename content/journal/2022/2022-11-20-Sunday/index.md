I just migrated all of my Org-roam notes into Denote. I've been switching between them for months and have recently decided to commit to Denote. I migrated everything using [Notes migrator](https://github.com/bitspook/notes-migrator/blob/master/nm-org-roam-to-denote.el).

I don't feel much like talking about the "fediverse" and I sure as hell don't feel like talking about Twitter.
