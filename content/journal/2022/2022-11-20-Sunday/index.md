I just migrated all of my Org-roam notes into [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote). I've been switching between them for months and have recently decided to commit to Denote. I migrated everything using [Notes migrator](https://github.com/bitspook/notes-migrator/blob/master/nm-org-roam-to-denote.el).

I don't feel much like talking about the "fediverse" and I sure as hell don't feel like talking about Twitter.

The above quote is from a newly ex-Twitter employee and refers to his boss, Elon Musk. Regardless of what one thinks of Elon, I agree with not being told who to hate.

<div class="simple-bq">

Sure, sure, you're right. But, Bezos could also _not_ give it away.

The last thing I need to see are more "street photos" of random people in NYC. I'm bored with the idea of NYC being the only place, other than, what, Tokyo? for interesting photography.

Every single post in my Mastodon timeline is about Mastodon. Maybe I'll head over to [Tumblr again](https://jackbaty.tumblr.com/).

There is no todo app that will help me actually get things done. Best they can do is help me remember what I'm supposed to do.
