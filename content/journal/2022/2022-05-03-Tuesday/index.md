Still waffling on <mark>Hugo vs Ghost</mark>. I spent so much time over the weekend setting up Ghost and migrating content. I like how it looks and I like the editor. I like just dragging images to make galleries or featured images. I like that switching templates is much easier. I like that I get a built-in newsletter engine for free. I like that I can just edit a post in place right in the browser rather than Emacs-&gt;Org-&gt;Hugo-&gt;sync. But, it's not plain text. I can't write in Org-mode/Emacs. I don't understand Ghost templates. Hosting requirements are higher. On top of all that, I feel like a "static website" person, not a "use a CMS" person. I know that's silly, but I can't ignore it.

**UPDATE:** We're back on Hugo for baty.net. I had fun tinkering with Ghost but it just doesn't _feel_ right. (This is me [using what I have](https://baty.net/2022/use-what-you-have/))
