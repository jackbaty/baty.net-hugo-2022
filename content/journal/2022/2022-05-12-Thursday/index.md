Alice's poop was semi-normal this morning, but the best news is that she slept from 11:00 pm until 5:00 am which means I had five whole hours of uninterrupted sleep. That's not nearly enough sleep, but I'll take it, since I've not had more than two hours at a time since Saturday.

...And thanks for hanging around for my compelling content!
