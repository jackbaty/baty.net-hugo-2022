AI continues to enthrall everyone. Here's DHH on AI creativity vs humans:

> Why shouldn't the same be true of AI generated novels, plays, or movies? What realm of creative production does not benefit from the out-of-the-norm inferences that computers have already proven they can make within the bounds of chess and go to great effect? Is what we call human creativity all that different from a large language model anyway? A distillation of observations, inputs, mimetic tendencies, and a wetware random generator?

Fair questions. I just wish he wouldn't keep calling us "mere humans".

In the meantime, JFC stop posting every single conversation you have with ChatGPT. It's _already_ boring.
