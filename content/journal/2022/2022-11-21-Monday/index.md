Ahh, DHH says that thing that only rich white guys can say with a straight face.

I'm having fun playing with [Capacities](https://capacities.io), a new-ish PKM tool similar to things like Notion and Craft. The biggest problem I see with it so far is that, just like all the others, it's not Emacs/Org-mode. That always ends up being a deal-breaker.
