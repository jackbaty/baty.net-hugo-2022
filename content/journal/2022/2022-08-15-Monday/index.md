I spent many hours yesterday getting my Emacs configuration running (based on [Crafted Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs)) so that I could continue using Notmuch for managing email. It worked well enough, until I got up this morning and suddenly mbsync fails with some generic SASL error. I tried editing .mbsyncrc but for some reason everything in my dotfiles has changed permissions to 644 and I'm no longer owner. JFC.

And now, `org-return-follows-link` doesn't work. And the list of recent files is showing a bunch of files I don't remember opening recently, and none of the ones I do. I'm still sick, so I shouldn't be making decisions right now, but my whole Emacs-based setup can fuck right off today.
