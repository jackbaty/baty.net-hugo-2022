I spent many hours yesterday getting my Emacs configuration running (based on [Crafted Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs)) so that I could continue using Notmuch for managing email. It worked well, until I got up this morning and suddenly mbsync fails with some generic SASL error. JFC.
