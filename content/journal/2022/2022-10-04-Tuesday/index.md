I got my invitation to [Tana](https://tana.inc/) yesterday. At first blush it feels like a combination of Roam and Tinderbox and TiddlyWiki. Not sure yet if it's too Notion-like. I dislike Notion so that would be bad. I'm going to give it a spin for a while and see.

I'm working at my old office today. It's weird, but fun. Nice to be somewhere besides my basement for a change.
