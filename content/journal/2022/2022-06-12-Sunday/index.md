I spent more time yesterday testing the [new (alpha) version of TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com/products/thebrain/thebrain13). Changes to the notes editor are quite nice. A little too WYSIWYG for my taste, but I think most people will like it. The biggest problem is that TheBrain is not Emacs. I find TheBrain to be wildly useful for making and finding connections. Its search is fast and there's really no fear of outgrowing it. But yeah, I want to use Emacs for notes. I could attach org files to "thoughts" and put my notes in those instead, but that seems like swimming upstream, especially with v13's improved Markdown editor. Still tinkering with it, though.

There is not enough energy in my life to spend it on <mark>finding things to bitch about</mark>.

These daily posts are often a <mark>replacement for entries</mark> in my personal journal. I probably put too many of my thoughts out here in public, but I like having them here...for later.
