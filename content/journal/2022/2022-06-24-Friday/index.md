After my brief [existential crisis](https://baty.net/2022/tmi/) yesterday, Alex was kind enough to [remind me why I do it this way](https://fondoftea.com/2022/06/23/). I feel better now, thanks.

I just logged into my just-in-case WordPress installation running at [v8.baty.net](https://v8.baty.net) and was bombarded by a <mark>half-dozen plugin messages begging for attention</mark> and feedback and asking that I "Upgrade to Premium!". Stop it. WordPress can do anything, but I don't like how it actually does much of it.

If I wanted to create a new blogging tool from scratch, I would probably build something very close to [what Drummer is](http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml). It's too bad I don't feel comfortable [investing time in](http://oldschool.scripting.com/jackbaty/) Drummer.

The <mark>bad guys keep winning</mark>. How are we letting this happen over and over?
