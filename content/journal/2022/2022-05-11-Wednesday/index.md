Good morning. My <mark>dog's had diarrhea</mark> for 3 days and that has meant getting up to take her out every 2 or 3 hours which also means that I've gotten almost no decent sleep this week. How's your day going? üí©

Speaking of Alice, I got another yawn shot yesterday.

I had a scary issue with [EagleFiler](https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/) so I emailed support and in 20 minutes I got a response from [Michael Tsai](https://mjtsai.com/blog/) with the solution. This is the great thing about using established, thoughtful, cared for apps.

Nice intro to Hugo: [Getting set up in Hugo | CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-beginner-tutorial/)

I've gotten a couple of questions about this blog's theme, so I added some notes to the [About page](/about/)

One nice thing about the [Leica M10-R](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/cameras/m/m10-r-black) is that when there's a firmware update I don't have to sift through all sorts of video updates to get to the good stuff.

Sure wish Capture One had "Select Subject". Oh, and an ecosystem.
