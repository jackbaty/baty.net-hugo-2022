☀️   Clear +67°F

I fired up my old [Blot blog](https://jackbaty.blot.im) yesterday for no particular reason. It was fun to play with [Blot.im](https://blot.im) again. I got so excited that for a minute I considered moving this blog over to Blot. I like the simplicity of Blot vs Hugo. It's just markdown files in a Dropbox folder. There's no deployment or rendering or dependencies and I find that attractive. I just don't know if I have the energy to do a migration like that right now. The other option is to use a new domain. It used to be hosted at baty.blog but I no longer have that domain. I'll have to think about it. Maybe I'll live there for a while.
