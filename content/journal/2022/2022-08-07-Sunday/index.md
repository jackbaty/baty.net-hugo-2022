> I find that many of my favourite lyrics are those that I do not fully understand. They seem to exist in a world of their own â€“ in a place of potentiality, adjacent to meaning. The words feel authentic or true, but remain mysterious, as if a greater truth lies just beyond our understanding. I see this, not just within a song, but within life itself, where awe and wonder live in the tension between what we understand and what we do not understand.

I feel this way about photographs.

Years ago I paid $500 for a "lifetime" subscription to [Roon](https://roonlabs.com) and I couldn't be happier. Around that time I also paid $500 for the "True Believer" 5-year subscription to [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) and I wish I hadn't.
