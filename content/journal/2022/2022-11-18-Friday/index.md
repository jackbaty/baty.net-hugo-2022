It snowed a little today.

I have mixed feelings about all the gatekeeping going on by Mastodon “old-timers”. I understand that what they want is to maintain the culture that they’ve worked so hard to cultivate, however, culture is determined by the people in the community. There are a lot more (new) people now, so things are going to change, whether you wish them to or not.

I'm in that mood again where I want to use as few apps as possible to run things around here. One trigger for this is that I really love the Arc Browser. Arc makes me want to use more web apps. For example, I've been running Slack in a browser tab rather than using the Mac app. Also, I'm using Fastmail's web UI instead of Apple Mail. I even flirted with Tana for a minute.

Please, can we not do that?

I have thousands of saved PDFs and web pages in my DEVONthink "Library" database and I never look at or use any of them. My other database, "File Cabinet" containing receipts and copies of my writing, software receipts, etc. is much more useful. I may just bail on the Library.
