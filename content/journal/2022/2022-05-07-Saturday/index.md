Trying to make some <mark>digital prints</mark> this morning. I wonder if I'll ever get to the point where I don't hate everything about the process. I don't know what's worse, scanning film or digital printing.

Today I learned that <mark>botheration</mark> is an actual word. How fun! I'm officially coining the phrase "Botheration Nation". For what, I don't know. Just read the news, I guess.
