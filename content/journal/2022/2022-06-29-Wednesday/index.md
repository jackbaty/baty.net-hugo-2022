⛅️  Partly cloudy +63°F

I ordered a bunch of <mark>paraphernalia around keeping index cards</mark>. I mean, I already _have_ a lot of it, but I ordered more: storage boxes, dividers, more cards, etc. This almost guarantees that I won't be using index cards in the future.

I've been testing [DxO PhotoLab 5](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/) and it's quite good. I used to love using "U-Point Technology" years ago in the old Nikon Capture NX app and it's fun to see how far it's come. But it's not U-Point or "Smart Lighting" that draws me to it. It's the lens profiles and the completely amazing DeepPRIME noise reduction. It's like having at least two additional stops available. I may end up buying [DxO PureRAW](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-pureraw/) so I can have just the good bits of PhotoLab as a plugin.
