In [this Stereogum piece](https://www.stereogum.com/2190488/the-number-ones-barenaked-ladies-one-week/columns/the-number-ones/amp/), Tom Breihan kind of blames Barenaked Ladies for our current billioniare situation:

> The three guys who are constantly competing to be the richest man on the planet? All fucking dorks. They expect us to love them for it, too. I didn’t like the shadowy ratfuckers who ran the planet before those guys, but they at least had the decency to be shadowy ratfuckers. They didn’t care if people admired them.

Why is it that <mark>nothing good</mark> seems to happen at the computer lately?

How does one maintain an internet presence without it <mark>becoming mostly performative</mark>? Or is _any_ internet presence performative, by definition?

With film, it's easy to convince myself that the <mark>best image on a roll must be a good photo</mark>. That is often not the case. When shooting digital, on the other hand, I just keep shooting and almost nothing stands out in that endless stream of photos. Maybe this is why I like film.

Why do I even do any of this? It's not as if it's _necessary_ to anyone. It's not as if I'm contributing much value. <mark>Why do I feel the need to write down whatever pops into my head</mark> and actually _publish_ it? Maybe it's just a form of therapeutic journaling. Also, I don't know how to stop.

Prot has put together a nice [intro to Denote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLzFJcLpDFI). This package is really coming along nicely.
