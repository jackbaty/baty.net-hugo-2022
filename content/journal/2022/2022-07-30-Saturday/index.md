Spent a day at the beach for the first time this summer. It was a perfect day, and a wonderful place to read. I took some photos with the little Stylus Epic, but there wasn't much interesting. Of course I did end up with at least [one self-portrait](/photo/2022/20220730-from-the-beach/).

The [modus themes](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes) for Emacs are the only ones I've found that properly set faces for Org-mode drawers to a monospaced font even in buffers set to use variable-width fonts. Most themes catch things like `:CLOSED:` and `:SCHEDULED:` but miss `:PROPERTIES:`.
