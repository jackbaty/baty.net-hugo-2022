Well, here we go again, I guess. I don't know if I can take any more of that asshole.

I've been a fan and proponent of NASA since I was a kid. I thought of them as miracle workers. Today, I'm happy that Artemis didn't explode on the launchpad. I guess I've learned to temper my expectations as I get older.

I'm not sure why I'm posting another journal entry here, since I prefer the way [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) handles it.
