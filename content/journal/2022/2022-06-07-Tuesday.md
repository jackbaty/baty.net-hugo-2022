ðŸŒ¦   Light rain, mist +63Â°F

I bought a <mark>reef tank</mark> this week. I've always admired salt-water aquariums and wondered what it would be like to keep one. I'm about to find out. I'm already learning that I have a shit-ton to learn. One of those things is patience.

Publicly <mark>posting every passing thought</mark> is unnecessary and uncalled for, but I can't seem to stop. At least I'm not spamming everyone's Twitter feed with them.

Late last year I created a <mark>folder on my Mac's desktop</mark> named "Beyond the Infinite". It's for dumping all the various detritus I collect on the desktop and don't know what else to do with. It's become a minor treasure. It's like a journal of things that barely matter at the time, but become valuable later. Screenshots, text snippets, URLs, etc. I love it.

Prot is on a roll...

> Denote is a simple note-taking tool. It is based on the idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme. The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata. Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files.

**6:00am:** "Plain text is The Way!" <br />
**7:30am:** "Plain text is unnecessarily limiting and living there is wasted opportunity!" <br />
**5:00pm:** "It happened again today, didn't it?"
