Well, I sold the Leica M10-R. Now what?

I renewed my omg.lol profile: [omg.lol/jbaty](https://omg.lol/jbaty). I don't know what it's for, but I'll get it updated anyway. It's five bucks a year, so not a difficult decision.

I've added this blog's [RSS feed](https://baty.net/index.xml) to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) so blog posts here will cross-post to Micro.blog. I'm not sure whether I'll include the posts on the main page here. They're included for now as "status" posts. Maybe I'll create a separate page and feed just for those. Also, I don't yet know what "those" means.
