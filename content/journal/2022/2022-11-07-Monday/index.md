Good morning. It's 4:45 am and I'm posting to three different blogs already

Mondays are for thinking about how I'm going to improve the situation for myself, family, and friends. Today feels different. Today feels like it could be the Monday before Democracy begins its move to hospice.

Each morning, I wake up, walk the dog, sit down at the computer, and decide to tear down everything I'd done the day before.

Mastodon is currently a flurry of posts either offering advice to new users or chiding those offering that advice.

Was reading a forum thread about storing film negatives and a surprising number of people separated them by film size or camera. To me, that's not a good sign.

I don't think my digital note-taking tools are doing the best job of helping me be smarter/more creative/whatever.

> I hear from people who somehow have their Kindle app and their note-taking app synched up so that everything they underline goes straight into their note-taking app. I think this is a terrible thing to do.

I've been very happy having only one computer but there are days when I wouldn't mind trading my M1 MBP for a Studio and M1 Air.
