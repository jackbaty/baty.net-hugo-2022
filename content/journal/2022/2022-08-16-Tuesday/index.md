I'm typing this in Emacs as an Org-mode file and I guess that means Emacs and I have made up after our little tiff yesterday.

I'm also running an Emacs config based on [Crafted Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs), which is pretty minimal and easy to get one's head around. It also means I'm continually frustrated by things not being as polished and custom as in Doom. I'm taking solace in the fact that I'm learning _real_ Emacs this way.

This could be a good idea: [A Well-known Links Resource](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/well-known-links-resource/). Basically, they suggest indexing your site's outbound links and making them available.

I'm trying to train my fingers to use pinky-and-middle-finger for `C-x` and pinky-and-index-finger for `C-c`. It's not going well, yet.

I can't shake the feeling that DALL-E is the beginning of the end. Of what I'm not sure, but I am sure that it's a _lot_.

How about letting me delete a text in Messages with a single gesture and stop asking me to confirm every time. Give me Undo, instead. Please?
