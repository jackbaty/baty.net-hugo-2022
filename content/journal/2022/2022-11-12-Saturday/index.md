I've used and loved an [Ember Mug](https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=30843977826389) for a couple years and never felt the need to pair it with the companion app. But, the battery has been acting up lately so I thought I'd check it with the app. I can't pair the mug with my phone without creating an "Ember account". Why in god's name do I need an online account just to check the battery level in my coffee mug?

Early this year I wrote "[Breakage](https://write.as/jackbaty/breakage)" on Write.as. Many of the links on that post are broken. I hate myself.

I'm not officially leaving or anything, but I have pinned a "Be back at <span class="underline">\_\_</span>" post and downloaded my Twitter archive. Feels like something is happening.
