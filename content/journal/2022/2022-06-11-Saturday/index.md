There's a new version of TheBrain available: [TheBrain 13 Alpha](https://www.thebrain.com/products/thebrain/thebrain13). Of course I'm trying it! Big item this time is the notes editor and markdown improvements. Still no Vim bindings 😆.

Enough with the <mark>Dall-E silliness</mark>, already. My feeds are pretty much overwhelmed with nonsense Dall-E images and Wordle results.

> I have no knowledge of any specifics, no insider information of any sort (I'm an outsider for sure where Leica is concerned): but I think the "gestalt," as they say, of the Leica M10 was guided by a single person, a single vision. And from the evidence, it seems like that person must be a photographer. Regardless of who engineered it. That's just what it feels like.

Emacs users <mark>gloating about Github sunsetting the Atom editor</mark> probably don't remember how easy it is to switch editors when you haven't already invested half your life learning, then customizing the shit out of the hard one. 😜
