I don't have a job, so Fridays should mean nothing to me, and yet, I'm <mark>happy it's Friday</mark>.

Upgraded the <mark>Q2 Monochrom to firmware 2.0</mark>, which adds Highlight Weighted Metering. This is great becase the Q2M pretty easily blows highlights and they're unrecoverable. I'd much rather have crunched blacks than blown highlights.

I hate the feeling of <mark>needing to be seen</mark>.

I'm confident that <mark>we'll solve climate change</mark>. I'm less confident that we'll solve politics. Which means the future remains bleak.

Bringing a film camera "out and about" is less and less enjoyable for me. I'm learning to <mark>prefer digital</mark> for the snapshots and save film for specific events. This would all be easier if the MP didn't feel so damn good to simply hold.

I need to get over this...

> A large part of what makes me prefer film photos is just knowing they’re film photos. That means something to me, and influences how I respond to an image.
