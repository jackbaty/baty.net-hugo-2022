I don't feel like being here today. <mark>The world depresses me</mark>. The people in it depress me. I'm a middle aged white CIS male, which means I have little to worry about, personally, from our new reality. I'm privileged. I can't even imagine what the world must feel like for anyone _not_ like me. My heart breaks as I watch everything become darker for so many people.

I donate. I vote. I advocate with real people (meaning _not_ on social media). At some point I'll protest and it's looking more and more likely that, eventually, <mark>I'll fight</mark>.

In the meantime, writing random notes here about nothing important is therapy for me. You may think that I should <mark>shut up about trivial things</mark> in the aftermath of every horrific event in the world, but I disagree. Again, therapy. This for me not for you.

[Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) is really coming along nicely.

I'm once again obsessed with [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com) and have moved most of my note-taking there. It really does offer a great balance between note-taking and linking and search and scale. The friction of where to put/link things is just high enough that I don't fall into the collect-everything trap. Makes it more useful over time.

I hate that using a Leica MP makes me feel <mark>smugly superior</mark> to your run-of-the-mill hipster with an M6. Especially since most of them are probably making better photos than I am.
