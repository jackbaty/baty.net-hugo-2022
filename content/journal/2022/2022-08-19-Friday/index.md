I don't know why, exactly, but I fired up a Ghost blog at [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org). I'd planned to revivie my old Substack newsletter, so I migrated that content over to the new blog. Now, I'm not so sure I have the energy or discipline to maintain a newsletter, so the site could become a blog for when I'm not in the mood to use the static site generator on this site. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
