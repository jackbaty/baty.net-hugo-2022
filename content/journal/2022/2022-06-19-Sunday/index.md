The <mark>bikes vs cars</mark> debate has descended into unreasonableness.

I haven't been in <mark>the mood for writing actual Blog Posts</mark> lately. I can't seem to muster the energy it takes to put together useful sentences or thoughts around a topic deserving of its own post. I much prefer just rambling about whatever I'm thinking about in these daily posts instead. There's no pressure. I don't have to think of a title. I don't have to create an outline or even be coherent, for the most part. It's freeing to just type about anything and everything and not have to worry about structure or categorization, etc. I hope you don't mind.

I ran into a <mark>fellow pen nerd</mark> at a party last night. We talked at length about inks and pens and papers and sizes and and and. It made me realize how few people I know, in real life, share my odd interests. I may need to join a club or two...if there are any.

YouTube is just a bunch of <mark>people trying to outscream each other</mark> for attention. If I had my way, they would ban custom video thumbnails.

Instead of <mark>going out and taking photos</mark> I think I'll sit at the computer and fart around with how I edit and manage them. Dummy.
