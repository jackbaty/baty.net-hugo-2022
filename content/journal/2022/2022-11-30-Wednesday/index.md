I've been futzing around in Emacs all day. It's been both wonderful and frustrating, but I think I'm getting somewhere. Most of the day was around [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote), Email, and my capture process.

Trying Prot's [Standard Themes for GNU Emacs](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/standard-themes) because it looks like default Emacs but as an actual theme. Here's the introduction:

> The standard-themes are a pair of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs. They emulate the out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute a theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency, customizability, and extensibility.
