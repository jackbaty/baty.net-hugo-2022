Have you noticed I changed the theme again? You've seen it before, and now it's back. [Again](/2022/loveit/).

I prefer to edit most things in Emacs. It makes moving to other software for _anything_ rather difficult.

Let's see, so far today I have reworked this blog with a new theme and also posted to [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com) for no particular reason other than I don't always feel liking making a new text file just so I can post something. Not sure that makes sense, but that's where we are today. Once again, I'm completely undecided.
