I have got to find a way to get more sleep. According to Autosleep, I've been averaging around five and a half hours. I need seven.

There's been nothing much happening over at [the wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). I don't know what to do about that. My daily notes are here on baty.net and the rest of my notes have been in Denote/Org mode. Writing topic notes publicly was perhaps too performative, but it was also motivating for me. I'm sure I took better notes in public. Still mulling this over.

I suppose I should write an actual blog post about moving my email from Mu4e to Notmuch, but I don't feel like it. I mean, the gist of it would be simply "Hey, I moved my email from Mu4e to Notmuch!" with a few unhelpful paragraphs about why. Can't I just mention it here and move on?
