I'm sorry <mark>you won't be getting Stage Manager</mark> on your non-M1 device. To me, the expectations and outrage around this is a testament to how well Apple has managed the overall transition to Apple Silicon.

I like learning about things, but I tend to stop there.

I can't tell if everything is important to me or if nothing is.

Hey Jack, don't you dare spend another <mark>entire day clicking links</mark> and hoping something captures your attention for more than ten seconds.

Yesterday I was <mark>100% back in Emacs/Finder/Browser</mark> mode for everything. This morning I reread my post, [Reset to Defaults](/2022/reset-to-defaults/) (from only _a month ago_) and now I'm re-thinking everything. Again. Sigh.

Still some of the best journaling advice I've seen: [Hyrule Bitchstoria](https://wutheringmights.tumblr.com/post/676144202419142656/i-always-have-to-give-to-advice-to-people-so-i)

I've noticed that I say "God fucking dammit!" out loud several times every day. That doesn't seem like a sign of someone who is emotionally healthy.

[How to read and share Notes | Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/notes). No thanks. I don't want any more things that <mark>aren't blogs</mark>.

I love that [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) shows posts that have been updated and indicates the changes. That right there could make it worth a subscription.

... I feel seen.
