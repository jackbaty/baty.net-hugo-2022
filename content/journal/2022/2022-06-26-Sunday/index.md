I <mark>record the weather</mark> when each of these daily posts is created, but I'm not sure why. It's another one of those "that's a fun and clever thing to do" things that doesn't actually help anything. I guess as long as it's not getting in the way, but knowing that there are dependencies in my post creation macro and in the theme files worries me.

Everything I publish online is always <mark>one big draft</mark>. This is fine with me, as I prefer flying fast and loose, but I do sometimes wonder what all this is a draft _of_. "Dunno," is the answer.

Added a [Changelog](/changelog/) page here. I'll try to keep it updated.

I spent this morning migrating the theme from my CodeIt fork back to LoveIt. Post: [The LoveIt theme is back](https://baty.net/2022/loveit/)
