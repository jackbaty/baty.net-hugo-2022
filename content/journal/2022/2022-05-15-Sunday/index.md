Thinking about <mark>changing how daily notes work</mark>. I feel that putting most things in [my wiki](https://wiki.baty.net) gives me the most benefits, even if it's weirder for visitors. So I'm planning to spend more time writing this stuff there instead. For here on baty.net, I may post a daily photo or summary or quote or something. We'll see.
