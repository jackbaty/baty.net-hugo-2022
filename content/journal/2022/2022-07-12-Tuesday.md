There's a point at which "content creators" <mark>go from sharing stuff to selling stuff</mark> and it's around that point that I lose interest.

Installed the <mark>Ventura public beta</mark> on my MBP. I assume things will start breaking soon.

Reef tank update: <mark>3 fish and 3 corals</mark>. We now have the black Clownfish, a Bi-color Blenny, and a Royal Gramma. The corals are all soft corals for now while I dip my toes in. Two of the three are doing well. Not sure about the third.

One of the last things I need is a "Weekly TextExpander Report"
