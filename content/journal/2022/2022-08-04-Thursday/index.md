I've spent time the past two days moving my email management in Emacs from Mu4e to Notmuch. I should jot down some of the details but I don't have the energy for that yet.

I'm trying to decide what to include in the main RSS feed here.

Have you any idea how many hours I've spent in pursuit of saving myself a handful of keystrokes?

Does it feel like we're in the final days of peak TV? It's sad.
