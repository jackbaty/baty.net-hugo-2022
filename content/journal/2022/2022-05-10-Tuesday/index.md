It might be time to admit that [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) is outdated. It probably _is_ malice.

One difference between a tool like <mark>Logseq and Org-roam</mark> is that with Logseq, connections just appear and are easy to spot. It makes serendipitous discovery more likely. With Org-roam it feels like I need to go _looking_ for connections. If I need to go looking, the tool is less useful.

I finally cleaned my mouse ([MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005647.html)) and my whole world feels better.

I prefer wired devices but I hate wires.
