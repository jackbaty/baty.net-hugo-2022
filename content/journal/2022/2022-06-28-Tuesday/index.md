☝️Me, every day.

One thing about [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com) is that its "knowledge graph" visualization isn’t just a clever side effect of linking (see [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)). It's core to the way the app works.

[Capture One for iPad](https://www.captureone.com/en/products/capture-one-for-ipad) is out today. I've been using the beta. It's fine, not great. Wish it was free with my desktop license, but they want $5/month. One-way sync only so far. Still, I'm happy to see it.

I honestly don't know if using Emacs for everything should be considered keeping things simple or making them <mark>as complicated as possible</mark>.
