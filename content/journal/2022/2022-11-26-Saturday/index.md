Good morning. I can tell it's going to be an Emacs kind of day. I just wish it weren't a why-the-hell-doesn't-org-download-work-right kind of day.

Four 4x5 sheets of HP5 are washing and I just loaded a roll of 120 on the reel. I've no idea if anything good will come of it but at least I _did_ something today. For a change.
