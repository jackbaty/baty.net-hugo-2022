Good morning. I can tell it's going to be an Emacs kind of day. I just wish it weren't a why-the-hell-doesn't-org-download-work-right kind of day. I'm going to gut everything Doom Emacs does to org-download and configure it myself. I think I tried and failed at this before but here goes.

Four 4x5 sheets of HP5 are washing and I just loaded a roll of 120 on the reel. I've no idea if anything good will come of it but at least I _made_ something today. For a change.
