New post: [I need a new film scanner](/2022/i-need-a-new-scanner/)

I thought the M10-R would cause me to shoot less film, because it's, you know, a Leica M but digital. Turns out that the <mark>Q2 Monochrom is the camera that has been distracting me from film.</mark> I like everything about it.

I wish I would <mark>shoot more video</mark>, but I don't enjoy shooting video.
