I spun up my own [Mastodon instance](https://social.baty.net). I'm still not sure why. I love that my username is [@jack@baty.net](https://social.baty.net/@jack), though. The problem with self-hosting something like this is I need to commit to it _forever_ and that's a long time.

At least Twitter is _interesting_ again, even if not in a good way.

Played a round of [Walkabout Mini Golf](https://www.mightycoconut.com/minigolf) with a friend again last night. I really enjoy getting together that way. Maybe Zuck is onto something :).
