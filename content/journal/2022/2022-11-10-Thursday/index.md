I spun up my own [Mastodon instance](https://social.baty.net). I'm still not sure why. I love that my username is [@jack@baty.net](https://social.baty.net/@jack), though. The problem with self-hosting something like this is I need to commit to it _forever_ and that's a long time.

At least Twitter is _interesting_ again, even if not in a good way.

Played a round of [Walkabout Mini Golf](https://www.mightycoconut.com/minigolf) with a friend again last night. I really enjoy getting together that way. Maybe Zuck is onto something :).

I saw this quote by Nick Cave today and ordered [the book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374607370/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8) immediately:

> The luminous and shocking beauty of the everyday is something I try to remain alert to, if only as an antidote to the chronic cynicism and disenchantment that seems to surround everything, these days. It tells me that, despite how debased or corrupt we are told humanity is and how degraded the world has become, it just keeps on being beautiful.
