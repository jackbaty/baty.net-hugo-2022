I never watched "<mark>The Sopranos</mark>" in its heyday. I started the first season this week. I can see the appeal, but I don't know if I care enough (after 7 episodes) to spend the time on six seasons of a TV show.

Wanting an app to be basically a wrapper over <mark>a set of Markdown files</mark> in a folder is fine, but as a requirement it's a silly place to draw a line.

If I could just agree with myself to <mark>use Emacs for most writing and note-taking</mark>, life would be a lot simpler. Even though at times I tire of living in all-text, all-the-time, the alternative of moving stuff around and having to decide where to put things all the time is a terrible way to live.

I hate how being <mark>addicted to the computer</mark> makes me feel.

My god we just keep <mark>talking about the same things</mark> over and over. Do I need a new community or is this just the world now?

I'm happy to have a <mark>place to vent</mark> that doesn't involve bothering everyone on social media platforms all day.

Ordered 900 dog poop bags. There.

If [Kids In The Hall](https://www.cbr.com/the-kids-in-the-hall-best-characters-debuted-early/) comes back I'll be so happy.

I just looked up my [EagleFiler](https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/) serial number in DEVONthink because Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯.
