At some point a fella needs to pick a path and walk it. I'm currently posting to five personal blogs at once. This is not sustainable. I'm now working through [baty.net](https://baty.net) vs [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) and will likely delete [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com) and [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org).
