I spent some time tinkering with Bastian Bechtold's  [org-static-blog](https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog). I was thinking I could use it for publishing some Org-mode notes. Since I already have [notes.baty.net](https://notes.baty.net/) being rendered with Hugo, I didn't see a need to switch. Clever package, though. Nice and simple.

[org-roam is absolutely fantastic! (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/veesun/orgroam_is_absolutely_fantastic/): Some good stuff here.

I get it, already, <mark>GPT-3 can make sentences</mark>. Is it really necessary to post every single one of them?
