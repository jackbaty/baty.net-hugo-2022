Well, it’s October now, I guess. Each new month begins with promise and another empty page. I get to choose how to fill the pages. Recently, it feels like too many of them remain empty. I need to fix that.

The <mark>Paper vs Digital debate</mark> continues apace. One nice thing about notes on paper is that I’m not tempted, nor do I feel obligated, to share them. On the other hand, what if I do want to share them?

Scrintal opened up their waitlist for anyone willing to pay an introductory annual subscription fee, so I jumped on it. Then after 10 minutes I realized <mark>I have no need for yet another note-taking app</mark> so I wrote them asking for a refund. It looks like a fine tool, but I need to pass.

I should probably lead with this, but after a month of testing this blog at [Blot.im](https://blot.im) I am bringing it <mark>back home to Hugo on my VPS</mark>. Maybe I'll write up some details later.

> ...these two attributes combined to create something very special in PHP: support for the “hackish state”, an environment optimal for casual tinkering with server-side scripting — without having to bring out a whole framework and take the time to set it up. If you had an idea for some kind of dynamic, server-side behaviour, you could probably have it prototyped in PHP in 15 minutes. It might be crude, but it would be real.

I'm willing to bet that if I took up PHP again and just ran with a bunch inline MySQL queries and CSS and a lot of copy and paste, I could outrun all y'all.

More like "Read Never" amirite?
