Seems that Github has added a mini Airtable feature called [Projects (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects). I don't need that, but I can imagine uses for it.

[Openverse: Why This Project Is Good for WordPress and the Web – WP Tavern](https://wptavern.com/openverse-why-this-project-is-good-for-wordpress-and-the-web). Is it, though? I'm not sure what we need is to make it even easier to add giant, unnecessary, irrelevant images to more blog posts.

I'm once again wondering what real value I get from [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). I keep renewing my subscription but honestly I could just use Twitter/Mastodon/Tumblr and be fine.

Stop doing Prompt Tweets.

Guido don't mince words:

I was an hour and a half into "The Batman" when I realized it was only half over. Decided I didn't need another 90 minutes of dark, wet, and broody so I shut it off.
