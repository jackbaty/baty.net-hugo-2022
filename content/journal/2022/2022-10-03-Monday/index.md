Well, my weight hit a new high this morning, so I've got that going for me.

In case anyone was wondering, I'm still waffling between [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92) and [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/). My brain is more comfortable with the simplicity of Denote, but Org-roam makes my notes more generally useful. Or at least it does so more easily.

Well goody, my crown is sensitive and feels much like it did right before it fell off a week ago. I'm off to the dentist as soon as this roll of film is out of the wash.
