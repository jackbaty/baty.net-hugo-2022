Well, my weight hit a new high this morning, so I've got that going for me.

In case anyone was wondering, I'm still waffling between [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92) and [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/). My brain is more comfortable with the simplicity of Denote, but Org-roam makes my notes more generally useful. Or at least it does so more easily.
