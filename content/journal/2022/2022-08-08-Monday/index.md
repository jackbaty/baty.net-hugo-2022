I was looking for something that I would have written while using org-roam so I re-enabled org-roam in my config and went looking. I was sidetracked immediately because the org-roam results buffer was showing links in their raw form and it was distracting. After an hour of digging, testing other versions, etc, I found [this comment](https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/org-roam-backlinks-appearing-with-id/2716/5?u=jbaty) which pointed to a fix (e.g. `(setq org-fold-core-style “overlays”)`, added in org 9.6). Happy to have that fixed, but the adventure reinforced that I'm probably better off staying in [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) for my notes.

I described the new Elvis biopic as "Everything Elvis All at Once". It was too much of everything and not enough content. Someone said it was more like a 2-hour movie trailer and I think that nails it.
