I wonder how long I'll have the energy and time to do this every day. Oh, I don't know, it's been like 20 years already, so.

We sure spend a lot of time on fancy tooling and frameworks for what boils down to the same simple CRUD apps we've been building for 30 years.

I have seven years of entries in my daybook.org file. I suppose that means it works for me, but it could also just be inertia.
