[Hello Medium readers, authors, editors and publishers | by Tony Stubblebine](https://coachtony.medium.com/hello-medium-readers-authors-editors-and-publishers-65bb728de2d8). I still kind of root for [Medium](https://medium.com). It seems that Stubblebine is pretty well-liked by people I like, so that's encouraging. Who knows, maybe I'll go back to cross-posting there.

I don't know if I should think of [Glass](https://glass.photo/jbaty) as a social network or portfolio.

I <mark>withdrew the M10-R listing</mark> again, after re-listing (again) it a couple days ago.

Complexity is OK as long as it's hidden, remains hidden, and never fails. Those three things are almost never true at the same time for long.
