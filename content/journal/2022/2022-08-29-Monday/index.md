⛅️  Partly cloudy +72°F

It's Monday morning at 5:10 am and I am supposed to start a "Weekly Review" soon but I don't feel like it. I don't feel like much of anything, actually.

I finished all 5 seasons of "Breaking Bad" last night. It may be Quality Television™, but it was also nothing but horrible people doing horrible things and I'm a lesser person for having watched it.

Raw speed is nowhere near the top of my list of things to consider when buying a keyboard.
