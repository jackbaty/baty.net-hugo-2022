⛅️  Partly cloudy +72°F

It's Monday morning at 5:10 am and I am supposed to start a "Weekly Review" soon but I don't feel like it. I don't feel like much of anything, actually.

I finished all 5 seasons of "Breaking Bad" last night. It may be Quality Television™, but it was also nothing but horrible people doing horrible things and I'm a lesser person for having watched it.

Raw speed is nowhere near the top of my list of things to consider when buying a keyboard.

I'm tempted to cancel every subscription I can reasonably live without.

After reading [The obsessive pleasures of modern keyboard tinkerers](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-obsessive-pleasures-of-mechanical-keyboard-tinkerers) (h/t [Phil](https://twelvety.blot.im/daily/2022/2022-08-28)), I of course wanted a new keyboard. Instead of shopping for one, I dug the [RealForce R2](https://www.realforcekeyboards.com/) out of the closet. It's a fine keyboard, and uses my favorite Topre switches, but it's just [not the same as my beloved HHKB](https://archive.baty.net/2020/can-realforce-replace-hhkb/).

Using a nice pen on good paper makes writing by hand a pleasure, but if I'm being honest I prefer typing most of the time. Especially when using a delightful keyboard or typewriter.
