I've finally gotten access to [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) but I promise not to share every single thing I ask it to generate. Like, say, "Sasquatch in a blue recliner drinking a cup of coffee.""

I love the way [Arc](https://thebrowser.company/) handles links from other apps by opening a small, dedicated window but with the option to move it into the main window. It feels like the way it _should_ work. It's amazing, but after several weeks I have basically zero complaints using Arc other than they need to support bookmarklets soon.

I couldn't figure out what was making an intermittent squeaky whistling sound. It sounded like it was coming from everywhere. It was my nose.
