Emacs suddenly stopped working this morning and I'm tired of it. (FIXED by reinstalling emacs-plus and running `doom sync`)

[ox-hugo added support for drawers](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/drawers/). I'm not sure what this is good for yet.

What can I do to put Texas and Florida under water sooner?

Just spent 20 minutes reading the most inane thread on the Leica forums. It's no wonder people with Leicas have a bad reputation. We deserve it.
