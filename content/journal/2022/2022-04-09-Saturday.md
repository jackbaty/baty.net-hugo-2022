The concern I have about <mark>using Doom Emacs</mark> is that I'm not really learning how to use Emacs, but rather how to use Doom. But damn it's fast and improves just about every aspect of Emacs.

How do I tell Instagram to <mark>stop notifying me</mark> that "so-and-so has added to their story"? I want _some_ notifications, just not those.

I took another look at [Notion](https://notion.so) and still find it to be an overwrought mess.

I like being able to <mark>write in an outline</mark>, but I don't like being _forced_ to. Hence my disillusionment with Roam and Logseq.
