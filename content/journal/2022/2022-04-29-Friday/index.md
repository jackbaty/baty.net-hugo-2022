I'm hungry.

Contemplating the <mark>pros and cons of using ox-hugo</mark> for posting here. [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) is awesome, but it's yet another layer of abstraction between what I'm typing and what ends up here. I mean, I get to use Org mode for writing, which is great, but Markdown is pretty good for just writing, too. Creating the necessary files/folders for new posts is a no-brainer in ox-hugo, once things are configured. But, how long would it take me to wire up the equivalent with a bit o' lisp and a snippet or two? With ox-hugo, everything is in one big Org file. I love the idea of this, but I don't know how _useful_ it is. Then again, it _works_!. Still noodlin'. Trying to remember to Use What You Have.

I've been using the <mark>stacking feature on my macOS desktop</mark> for a couple of weeks and, surprisingly, I don't hate it. I thought I'd hate it, but it's kind of nice having things organized for me. It's not the way _I'd_ normally organize things, but once I just let it do its thing, I stopped worrying about it.'

Moved my theme's git repo to Sourcehut, too. <https://git.sr.ht/~jbaty/codeit-theme>. It's part of the [baty.net project.](https://sr.ht/~jbaty/baty.net/) I have to admit, [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org) is growing on me.
