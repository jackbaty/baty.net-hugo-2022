I'm half an inch away from punting and just putting it all in <mark>Apple Notes</mark>.

As much as I love the [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com), having to use the function layer constantly via my right pinky is finally causing some discomfort in my hand. I may go back to the stock Apple keyboard or maybe the Realforce R2 that's in storage. New post: [I love the HHKB but my pinky hurts - Jack Baty's Weblog](https://baty.net/2022/i-love-the-hhkb-but-my-pinky-hurts/)

A nice attribute of [Reflect.app](https://reflect.app) is that the devs are in no way focused on collaborative features. This is a good thing. I don't need or want other people in my notes.

I miss using [my wiki](https://wiki.baty.net).
