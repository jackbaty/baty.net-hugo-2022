Did you know that you can toggle the display of hidden (dot) files in macOS Finder by hitting `Command-Shift-.` ? I didn't know that.

I get up each morning and sit down in front of Emacs and wonder if I'll still be there at the end of the day. Or will I have switched to some other tool. And back again.

12 hours later: I dove back into TiddlyWiki and TheBrain, with a short sidetrack into Curio, but yes, I'm back in Emacs this evening. As usual.
