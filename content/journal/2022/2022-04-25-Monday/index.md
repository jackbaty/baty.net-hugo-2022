I should really get my shit together.

I'm thinking of <mark>changing my complex-as-hell "productivity" system</mark>  with something simpler, like, "Write it down  so you don't forget it. Then do it as soon as you can."

I don't need more software. I <mark>need more ideas</mark> and the energy to act on them.

I'm already sick of hearing about <mark>people rage-quitting Twitter</mark> because Musk is buying it and _something bad_ might happen because of that. Twitter wasn't great yesterday, so let's see if any of the terrible things actually happen first, _then_ quit.

Ben Thompson can [stop suggesting](https://stratechery.com/2022/beyond-aggregation-amazon-as-a-service/) that companies should <mark>build out an advertising model</mark> any time. He's smart, and probably right, but it's not _right_ right, know what I mean?

I've made <mark>posting to this site</mark> as easy and fluid as I'm capable of but some days it's still too much friction.
