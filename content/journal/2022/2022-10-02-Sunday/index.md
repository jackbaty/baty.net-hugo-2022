⛅️  Partly cloudy +54°F

I'm writing in my journal this morning using Emacs and Org-journal. I really like the combination, but it's super nerdy and only works on my Mac. What I'd prefer is to use Day One so that all my image entries and longer notes could live in the same place and I could type them on any device. When I export a PDF every month it would be complete and once a year I could print a nice book with a selection of entries. So why don't I do this? Because I prefer typing in Emacs and Org-mode and I prefer the way exports from Emacs look. If I could get over that, things would get easier.
