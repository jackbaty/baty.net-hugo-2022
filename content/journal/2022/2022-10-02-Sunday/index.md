⛅️  Partly cloudy +54°F

I'm writing in my journal this morning using Emacs and Org-journal. I really like the combination, but it's super nerdy and only works on my Mac. What I'd prefer is to use Day One so that all my image entries and longer notes could live in the same place and I could type them on any device. When I export a PDF every month it would be complete and once a year I could print a nice book with a selection of entries. So why don't I do this? Because I prefer typing in Emacs and Org-mode and I prefer the way exports from Emacs look. If I could get over that, things would get easier.

Jeremy Friesen:

> An emerging note taking utility is Denote; in this document I want to explore my usage of Org-Roam; what I’ve come to expect (e.g. consider a “must have”) and what I’ve come to appreciate (e.g. consider a “nice to have”). I then want to look at how to achieve that in Denote.

I'll be keeping an eye on Jeremy's progress, as I waffle between Org-roam and [Denote](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) myself. After all, I just put [everything in Org-roam](/2022/everything-is-in-org/) so let's not get too comfortable, eh? One of the things that attracts me to Denote is that it's simple, considered, and doesn't try to be everything to everyone. Each member of the Org-roam community, on the other hand, seems obsessed with bending it to their specific will. It's a recipe for complexity.

Now that Roam and Roam-alikes are The Thing, maybe the web can get backlinks as originally planned.
