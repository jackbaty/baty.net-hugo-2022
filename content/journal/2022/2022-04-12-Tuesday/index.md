I've <mark>added comments here</mark>. Used [Cusdis - Lightweight, privacy-first, open-source comment system](https://cusdis.com/). It was super easy. We'll see how it feels, and if I like it enough once they start charging for the hosted option. I don't think I'm interested in self-hosting. My feelings about comments are usually mixed. I like having them available, but almost no one comments, so it ends up being mostly overhead. Plus, I prefer getting emails from people to drive-by comments.

This Focomat IIc is going to be the death of me. I plan to try and <mark>adjust the autofocus mechanism</mark> myself to see if I can get it to focus throught the entire range. I've also ordered a 75 watt bulb to replace the 150W bulb to try and get exposure times up to a workable duration.

I was able to <mark>replace the screen</mark> on (what will become) my mom's iPhone XR. I bought the repair kit from iFixIt.com for $99. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't want to do it every day.

[Glass.photo](https://glass.photo) has a web UI now. This makes it much more interesting for me. [My profile](https://glass.photo/jbaty).
