I don't see how anyone who has acquired more than a <mark>passing familiarity with Org mode</mark> would ever choose to write anything in Markdown. It's not fair that the only real tooling for Org is Emacs.

There's a subtle difference between <mark>what I want to say and what I want to share</mark>. The things I want to say but not force on people go here in these daily posts. Shared things go on social media and as posts below.

Toyed with the idea of moving some repos to [sourcehut - the hackers forge](https://sourcehut.org/). The idea is cool, and I love the old-school approach but man what a painful workflow after using Github for years. Not sure I can live like that.

Tell me you left social media without telling me you left social media.

[Slow Social](https://slowsocial.us/) seems like an interesting approach. How many people have the mindset for it, though?

I'm inclined to over-think my note taking process, but [this is next level](https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/).

As soon as I load up an article about social networks or productivity or what have you, I search for things like "walled garden" and "dopamine" and if I find any occurrences, I don't feel like I need to bother reading the article because it's almost certainly the same as all the others.
