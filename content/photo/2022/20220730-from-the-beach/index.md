I took the little Stylus Epic to the beach yesterday. Nothing much came of it, but here's a self-portrait from the day. Not sure what that flare is toward the bottom of the frame. The good news is that the Epic didn't make its usual grinding noises while rewinding. I was worried about the camera, but it seems fine now.
