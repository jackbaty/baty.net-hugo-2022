Other than having a couple of nits to pick, I really like using [HEY!][1] for my email.

After considering the pros and cons and waffling between dropping the service and going all-in, I&#8217;ve been leaning toward all-in. HEY offers an opinionated, clever, and pleasant set of features that&#8217;s not found elsewhere. A big missing piece for me has been custom domain support.

I&#8217;m fine paying the higher price for HEY because I love the service. For that price, though, custom domains should be table stakes. I was looking forward to consolidating things and canceling my long-standing Fastmail subscription once custom domains were supported. I would even pay a buck or two more for my own domain, even though I feel like the current price should include it.

I&#8217;ve known for months that custom domain support was coming, so I was waiting for that before committing.

I&#8217;m glad I waited, because as it stands I won&#8217;t be sticking with HEY.

Basically they&#8217;ve just rebranded HEY for Work as [HEY for Domains][2]. **I don&#8217;t want HEY for Work**. It&#8217;s only me here. I want HEY for You (aka Me) with my own domain.

So, instead of my custom domain riding atop the existing @hey.com address, I have to create and pay for an entirely new account to use custom domains. This means if I want to keep @hey.com I&#8217;ll be paying for both accounts. Nope.

So what&#8217;s the big deal about giving up the @hey.com address? Honestly, it&#8217;s not that big a deal. I&#8217;ve only sparingly used that address. I&#8217;ve been forwarding my baty.net email from Fastmail and using SMTP forwarding for replies. This works OK, but means I still need to keep (and pay for) my Fastmail account. I&#8217;d rather not. But, what&#8217;s worse is this&#8230;<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

You see, I also lose the option of using [HEY World][3]. To be fair, I&#8217;ve only dabbled with HEY World but it&#8217;s intriguing and could find a place at some point. Not if I move to HEY for Domains, it won&#8217;t.

I&#8217;ll keep saying it&#8230; I love HEY for my email. It&#8217;s an opinionated service, which comes with risks, but up to now the folks behind it have done a great job selecting and implementing features. I fear that with the way custom domains via HEY for Domains is implemented, I may not be able to stick around and see where it leads. This is a shame. I mean, the upcoming [Recycling feature][4] looks terrific and useful. I may never know.

This post is mostly a knee-jerk reaction to the HEY for Domains implementation. To be fair, it&#8217;s early and the Basecamp folks may decide to tweak things favorably if they receive a lot of feedback like mine. I have until June before my HEY for You subscription is up for renewal. I hope it works out.

**UPDATE** (2021-04-23 16:50): I didn&#8217;t know about the discount offered here: <https://hey.com/custom-domains/>. This offer makes using HEY for Domains much more palatable.
