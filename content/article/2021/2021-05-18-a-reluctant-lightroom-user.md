<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I&#8217;ve never loved editing photos in 

[Adobe&#8217;s Lightroom (Classic)][1]. It does the job fine, and it has all the tools one might need, but it&#8217;s no _fun_. I prefer editing with [Capture One Pro][2].

As much as I enjoy the editing process in Capture One, it otherwise feels like working on an island. C1 has no way to sync photos, the plugin/extension options are very limited, and while it works with other editors, it doesn&#8217;t do it as seamlessly as Lightroom. And so on.

Lightroom&#8217;s ecosystem is hard to beat. It works with nearly everything. I can sync with the mobile Lightroom CC library. It works with every plugin one could possibly want (most notably, [Jeffrey Friedl&#8217;s][3] and [Negative Lab Pro][4].) There&#8217;s no end to the presets and styles available. If I want to do something with a photo, Lightroom is more likely to be able to handle it.

Lightroom&#8217;s cataloging is more capable than Capture One&#8217;s. Or at least it feels easier to use. I&#8217;d prefer not having to rely on a specific vendor&#8217;s tool for managing my lifetime of photos, but it&#8217;s better than only having them scattered in folders. Believe me, I&#8217;ve tried it that way numerous times. It&#8217;s liberating, but only for a moment, then it quickly becomes frustrating.

And of course I don&#8217;t like having to pay a monthly subscription to Adobe. That said, for $20 a month I get Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, Lightroom CC on all my devices, and 1TB of cloud storage. It&#8217;s a pretty good deal.

While I&#8217;m still looking for excuses to go back to Capture One, I am, reluctantly, back in Lightroom Classic for the majority of my photo management. For now.
