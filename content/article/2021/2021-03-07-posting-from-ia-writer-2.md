<!--kg-card-begin: html-->Is this something I can do?

Sometimes I want a better environment for writing and posting to my blog. Ghost&#8217;s post editor is fine, but not &#8220;nice&#8221;. For writing with Markdown, [iA Writer][1]&#8216;s editor is hard to beat. I thought I&#8217;d see if there&#8217;s a way to post from iA Writer to Ghost.

There is. First I had to add an &#8220;App&#8221; in the control panel so I&#8217;d have an API token. I entered that and the corresponding endpoint URL in iA Writer. Now, I can write, add images, and post a new draft simply by right-clicking the post and hitting &#8220;Publish&#8230;&#8221;.

I can&#8217;t seem to add &#8220;Featured&#8221; images this way, which is too bad. Still for feel-good editing, using iA Writer for writing blog posts is worth it.
