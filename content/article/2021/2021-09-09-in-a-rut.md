Dogs, myself, and cameras are about the only things I&#8217;ve been photographing lately. I just don&#8217;t seem to have any ideas. Well, that&#8217;s not true; I have plenty of ideas, but I&#8217;m too lazy to act on them. So, I sit around the house and shoot what&#8217;s in front of me.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

I need to snap out of it.
