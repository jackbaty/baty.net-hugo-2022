Riccardo Mori has a few comments on the beta of Safari 15 showed up. Here&#8217;s one:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Safari 15 on Mac OS, a user interface mess" data-author="@morrick" cite="http://morrick.me/archives/9368">
  <p>
    In other words, what a browser needs is <em>horizontal</em> breathing room, instead we have Apple doing things backwards, sacrificing horizontal space to give us what, 28 more vertical pixels?

I can&#8217;t begin to describe how deeply I dislike the new tab handling in Safari 15.
