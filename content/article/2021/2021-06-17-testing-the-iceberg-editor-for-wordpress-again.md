<!--kg-card-begin: html-->Unless I&#8217;m doing some crazy non-standard layout, I&#8217;m not a fan of using WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor. Mostly I just want to type some simple text and add a link or two.

Last year I bought a license for [Iceberg][1] which is a lightweight Gutenberg replacement that feels more &#8220;normal&#8221;. I stopped using it because there was a kind of uncanny valley effect, but after several frustrating days wrestling Gutenberg, I&#8217;m trying Iceberg again. Here&#8217;s what this post looks like in Iceberg<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

This post is an excuse to to use it. Sorry for the noise.
