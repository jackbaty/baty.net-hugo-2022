<!--kg-card-begin: html-->None of the old books on my Kindle mean anything to me. They&#8217;re just there. I never see them, I never re-read them. I never 

_use_ them for anything. Seems like a waste.

In addition, I&#8217;ve recently purchased a couple of hardcover books that I didn&#8217;t enjoy. So now what? They&#8217;ve gotta sit on my shelf forever? I suppose I could always give them away, but that&#8217;s also work. (Advantage, _real_ books, though).

What about the library? While I love the idea of going to libraries, I almost never do. The pandemic hasn&#8217;t helped, of course.

I ruled out renting eBooks from my local library a couple years ago, since they didn&#8217;t use the only relevant rental/reading service, [OverDrive][1] with Libby. Haven&#8217;t thought about doing that again until recently, on a whim, I checked the library&#8217;s site and discovered that they have finally started making books available via OverDrive/Libby.

I signed in using my library card number, browsed a bit, and checked out 3 books. Two of these were only available in ePub format, so I&#8217;ll have to read them using the Books app on my iPad. But the third was available for the Kindle, which is what I was hoping for. For the record, the books are [Permanent Record][2] by Edward Snowden, [Zero World][3] by Jason M. Hough, and [Blindsight][4] by Peter Watts.

This is so cool! It means I get to experiment with all sorts of different books without the cost and commitment of ownership. I&#8217;ll still buy books, of course. I love books. I love _having_ books. But I&#8217;ll only need to buy the ones I actually wish to own.

The down side is that it&#8217;s kind of slim pickings when it comes to availability. I had to put &#8220;holds&#8221; on a couple of books that were high on my reading list because they weren&#8217;t available. And worse, they aren&#8217;t scheduled to be available for 2 or 3 _months_. It&#8217;s OK, this just means I need to dig though the archives and find things that haven&#8217;t necessarily been top of mind while I wait.
