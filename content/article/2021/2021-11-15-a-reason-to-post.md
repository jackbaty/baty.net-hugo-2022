I keep this blog around so that I have somewhere to post images and maybe a little background as well as the ever-popular gearhead nonsense. So why do I so rarely post anything?

I don&#8217;t post often because a blog dedicated to photography makes me feel that each post needs gravitas. Each post needs to be _worth_ something. Relevance.

Well that&#8217;s obviously not working, so I&#8217;d like to behave a bit more frivolous about things around here. Maybe I&#8217;ll post single images with a caption and that&#8217;s it. Maybe I&#8217;ll let you know what I&#8217;m thinking about cameras in general, or a specific camera I&#8217;ve been using or wanting to use.

So hey, here&#8217;s a photo of the appetizer at dinner recently. How&#8217;s that for frivolous?<figure class="wp-block-image kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption">
