Charlie is 15 and has slowed down some, but can still be cute when he wants to be.

I&#8217;ve been exploring color lately. I most often prefer black and white photographs, but I wonder if this is simply because I&#8217;m not good with color. I like the consistent, muted colors in this photo of Charlie.
