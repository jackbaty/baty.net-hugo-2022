<!--kg-card-begin: html-->As an antidote for my usual spiral of sitting at a giant screen full of a dozen windows, staring, clicking, staring, clicking, etc. I thought I&#8217;d try living on my iPad for a while.

I&#8217;m not an iPad person, even though I&#8217;ve used one since the day they were released. I just don&#8217;t understand how anyone thinks they can be anywhere near as productive on an iPad as on a &#8220;real&#8221; computer. Stockholm Syndrome or something, I always figured, but smarter people than I are doing it, so who&#8217;m I to judge?

I&#8217;m drawn to the idea of being forced to do only thing at a time. iOS does that. I&#8217;d probably do more than one thing at once if I could, but &#8220;multi-tasking&#8221; on iOS remains an unusable mystery, so I&#8217;m better off leaving it alone. Anyway, you get the idea.

Basically, I&#8217;d like a break from tinkering with my system(s) on macOS (hi Emacs!), so I&#8217;m going to spend some time living on this 12.9&#8243; (aka &#8220;Thirteen-inch&#8221;?) iPad with Magic Keyboard.

Challenges:

I&#8217;ll be forced to use the baby version of Lightroom. How will I handle exports, sharing, resizing, etc? And I hate that I don&#8217;t have control over where files go and what they&#8217;re named, but here we are.

Where does one take notes if there&#8217;s no Emacs and Org mode? Notes app? Drafts? Craft? Ulysses? Do I really want to venture into that rabbit hole again?

How do I get things from one place to another without easy access to multiple clipboards and my Mac&#8217;s desktop? How do I save things for later without Zotero? How do I do nearly anything without Alfred?

And so on.

But, iOS is calmer than macOS, and right now I need a little calm.
