<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I was supposed to sell the Leica SL once the SL2-S arrived. I almost did it, too. It&#8217;s technically still listed for sale in a couple of places, but I&#8217;m not ready to get rid of it yet. I mean just look at it.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large kg-card kg-image-card">

The Leica SL is five years old and still a wonderful camera. If I&#8217;m being honest, the brand new SL2-S is better, but not _that_ much better. I&#8217;m keeping the original because it&#8217;s awesome and it&#8217;s worth more to me to have around than the money I could get for it. This calculus could change, of course, but it&#8217;s kind of amazing that I have an _extra_ SL available. I don&#8217;t see the APO-Summicron-SL 35mm ever coming off the SL2-S, so it&#8217;s great that I can keep one of the M primes or the Zoom lens on the SL without having to switch lenses.

Another benefit of keeping the SL is that I can take it places I might not take the newer one. It seems silly to call the SL my &#8220;beater&#8221; camera but that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m thinking of it. If I drop or lose or have the SL2-S and Summicron stolen, I&#8217;m out a very significant amount of money. With the SL and cheaper lens it would still really hurt, but less. The SL has GPS built in and the SL2-S does not, which is handy for if and when I actually do go places again.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large kg-card kg-image-card">

I no longer have a camera to use for [scanning film][1], since I sold all my Fuji gear. I&#8217;m thinking about finding a cheap Nikkor macro and adapter and using the SL for the scanning station. Not an ideal use for such a fine camera, but should work well.

And finally, I get a little emotional about cameras. I sold the M10-P and hate myself for it, even though it was necessary at the time. I&#8217;m thinking that if I don&#8217;t _have_ to sell the SL, why not keep it around for a while?

I have had thoughts about finding a used Leica Monochrom. If I get serious about that I&#8217;d need to sell the SL to help fund the M. In the meantime, the SL won&#8217;t go to waste.

**UPDATE** (February 24, 2021): I sold the SL. Could not resist trying a Q2 Monochrom.
