<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I 

[got my first Kindle in 2007][1]. I had given up on Amazon letting me do the Most Obvious Thing, which is to use the current book&#8217;s cover on the lock screen.

But, after 13 years, I finally can!<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img loading="lazy" width="700" height="560" src="https://new.copingmechanism.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/R0001162.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-414" srcset="/content/images/wordpress/2021/04/R0001162.jpg 700w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/04/R0001162-300x240.jpg 300w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/04/R0001162-768x614.jpg 768w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/04/R0001162-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/04/R0001162-2048x1638.jpg 2048w, /content/images/wordpress/2021/04/R0001162-800x640.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> <figcaption>Finally!</figcaption></figure> 

(I&#8217;ll probably decide to disable it when reading &#8220;Fifty Shades&#8221;, though)
