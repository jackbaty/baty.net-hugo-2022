<!--kg-card-begin: html-->Here&#8217;s my star rating system for everything:

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Loved it!  
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ It was good  
⭐️⭐️⭐️ It was OK  
⭐️⭐️ I didn&#8217;t like it  
⭐️ Hated it

With me, everything gets 3 stars by default. Books, movies, photographs, everything: 3 stars right off the bat. I always assume that this new thing or person or conversation will be OK at the very least. This applies to more than just media. It applies to people, too. Sometimes I&#8217;m disappointed and end up with 1 or 2 stars, but more often than not I&#8217;m surprised and delighted and my opinion of something or someone goes up rather than down.

Too many people seem to start out assuming everything and everyone only deserve 1 or 2 stars. They expect to dislike everything by default. This doesn&#8217;t seem healthy to me. Why go out of your way to look for trouble?
