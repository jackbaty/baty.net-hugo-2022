It had been a while since I used the Olympus OM-1n. The Zuiko 85mm f2.0 has been a favorite lens for a long time, so I put a roll through the kit while helping a friend take his boat and dock out of the water for the season.

The OM&#8217;s viewfinder is still one of the biggest and brightest I&#8217;ve ever used. The camera itself is actually smaller than a Leica M. It&#8217;s a great setup. Here are a few highlights from the roll.
