> Writers spend way too much time and money seeking out their “grail” pen and paper combo — the tools that will make their work so much “smoother.” It’s a pattern we’ve seen repeated in all creative pursuits.

Why does he quote &#8220;smoother&#8221; here? Is that from something? It&#8217;s an odd word for describing creative work.

I&#8217;m happy that Chilvers has a setup that works for him and that he doesn&#8217;t feel a need to try anything else. A little envious, even. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t love the insinuation that people who try different tools are somehow on a futile and unnecessary quest that can never lead to anything other than frustration and reduced creative output. OK, that might be me reading too much into it, but, isn&#8217;t it possible that some people simply enjoy trying new things? Can the search for better or more enjoyable tools never be more than just blind consumerism or creative procrastination?
