I've owned a lot of cameras and lenses. 

[More than average][1], I&#8217;d say. I&#8217;ve of course sold more than I currently own. With few exceptions, I regret selling any of them.

Remember how the Nikon F6 printed exposure data between frames?

Or how nice it was having aperture-priority auto-exposure on the Leica M7?

Or the Mamiya 6 with its giant square negatives in an easy-to-shoot package?

I&#8217;ve been thinking about this lately while pondering all of the money I have tied up in various cameras and how infrequently I use some of them. My head tells me to sell everything I&#8217;m not using often, but my heart won&#8217;t let me. I always, _always_ regret selling camera gear, so I think I&#8217;ll hang onto all of it for now. At least until circumstances dictate that I cannot.
