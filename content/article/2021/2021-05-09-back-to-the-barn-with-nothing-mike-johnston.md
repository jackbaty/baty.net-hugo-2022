    But just because we always come back to the barn with &#8220;results&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean we got anything. When we get nothing, we have to have the discipline to know we got nothing, and not try to force it to be &#8220;something&#8221;

So much of the photography I see on the internet is made of snapshots that don&#8217;t work. Most of the stuff I post fails in the same way. One thing I&#8217;m doing to improve my self-evaluation is to immediately delete photos that don&#8217;t show me something first thing. This is riskly, but I&#8217;m betting that 99% of the time I&#8217;m right. This way I don&#8217;t spend hours trying to make something from nothing.
