<!--kg-card-begin: html-->After a year of buying really nice cameras and lenses, I&#8217;ve gotten to a point where I&#8217;m feeling the weight of having so much money tied up on photography gear. Some of it has to go. This post is me thinking it through.

<a href="http://baty.net/2021/selling-cameras/" data-type="post" data-id="570">I hate selling gear</a>. Dealing with buyers and potential buyers isn&#8217;t fun. Shipping is a pain. There&#8217;s always a risk of damage, loss, or dissatisfaction. But mostly, the problem with selling is that I no longer have the things I&#8217;ve sold. Regret sucks.

Something I&#8217;ve learned over the years is &#8220;never sell a Leica&#8221;. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve amassed too much Leica gear and I love it all, but it&#8217;s stressing me out.

The three systems in question are the film M bodies, the SL2-S, and the Q2 Monochrom.

I&#8217;d actually sold the Q2M to fund the MP but the buyer returned it. Instead of immediately re-listing it for sale, I started wondering if I&#8217;d regret it.

For a minute I thought I&#8217;d unload the entire SL2-S system instead. I have two Leica APO-Summicron-SL lenses, which were ungodly expensive. They&#8217;re _way_ beyond my abilities. The SL system is the most significant (cost-wise) and probably &#8220;sparks the least joy&#8221; of all of them. But it&#8217;s so versatile and that 35mm APO Summicron is so absolutely outstanding that I am certain I&#8217;d regret not having it. The 75mm on the other hand is an odd focal length and by far the least used lens I own. Hmmm.

The MP is wildly unnecessary but is perfect and beautiful and sparks all sorts of joy every time I even _think_ about it, so that&#8217;s not going anywhere. 90% of a new film Leica&#8217;s depreciation happens the minute I open the box, so there&#8217;s no benefit in selling it sooner.

So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking. I&#8217;ll sell the Q2M and the APO-Summicron-SL 75mm lens. That&#8217;s a significant amount of cash tied up in the least useful/versatile kit. And it means I still have the 35mm Summicron. For longer focal lengths (portraits, mostly), I have an Elmarit-M 90mm that focuses much more easily on the SL than the M bodies. I also have the SL Sigma 24-78 f/2.8 which is a fine lens and versatile for when someone asks me to shoot an event. (It happens occasionally, and I hate to say no).

What about the film Ms? I have the new MP, but I also have an M3, M4, and M6. I have an emotional attachment to the M3 and M4. The M6 is special because it&#8217;s one of the last 10 &#8220;classic&#8221; M6s made. It&#8217;s also had the viewfinder upgraded and unnecessary framelines masked out. It&#8217;s a damn fine copy and would fetch a crazy price right now, but I don&#8217;t think I can let it go. I&#8217;m definitely keeping the M3 because it&#8217;s, well, an M3. But also because of the .92x mag viewfinder, which is the only way I&#8217;m able to accurately focus the 90mm on an M.

That leaves the M4. I love it because it has the M2/M3-style film advance lever and frameline selector. It currently has a broken shutter, but I&#8217;m sending it to DAG for repair and a CLA. When it returns, I&#8217;ll list it for sale.

I&#8217;m hoping that selling the Q2M, M4, and 75mm APO-Summicron frees up enough cash to alleviate the guilt of having spent so much on &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; gear. I&#8217;m happy to also allow myself to keep the SL and 35mm. I won&#8217;t regret having them.

So if anyone is interested in any of those items, give me a holler.
