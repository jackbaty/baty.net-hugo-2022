I enjoy both film and digital photography, but the pendulum has been swinging toward film recently, and I&#8217;ve been having a ball.

I&#8217;ve finally dialed in a film processing, scanning, and editing workflow that works and that I don&#8217;t hate. What&#8217;s more, I&#8217;ve been studying my recent film photos and I really like them. I like that they&#8217;re not so perfect that zooming in to 100% is useful. I like the defects and unpredictability. I like the process. But most of all, I like the cameras. Specifically, I like Leica rangefinders.

I bought my first Leica M, an M6 TTL back in 2004. From there I&#8217;ve had an M3, M4, M6, M7, M8, and M10-P. Eventually, I ended up with a comfortable kit with an M3, M4, and M6 Classic. The M3 is great because it&#8217;s the first M, and the .92x finder magnification is perfect for 50mm lenses and makes shooting 90mm lenses feasible. The M4 is a more modern, but still entirely mechanical, non-metered body. And the M6 Classic is newer (still 20+ years old) and is metered.

Each of the M cameras was purchased used (of course). Their resale value has gone through the roof over the past few years. Clean M6 bodies go for twice what I paid for mine. Leica film cameras may not qualify as &#8220;investments&#8221; but they certainly don&#8217;t depreciate. At least they haven&#8217;t since I&#8217;ve owned them.

What I&#8217;ve never done is buy a brand new Leica M film camera, because that would be crazy. Why buy new when I can get something for a third of the price that works great and does basically the same thing? And unlike used bodies, new cameras _do_ depreciate. At least for a minute.

But I must admit to always dreaming of a brand new Leica M film camera. Leica only makes two: The [non-metered M-A][1] and the [metered MP][2].

Leica recently announced a special black-paint version of the digital M10-R and <a href="http://baty.net/2021/black-paint-leica-m10-r-beautiful/" data-type="post" data-id="725">I thought it looked beautiful</a>. It got me thinking about other black paint Leica bodies and how much I love that finish. Several of the older models were available with the gorgeous black paint finish, but they fetch even higher prices than the regular chrome and black chrome models.

I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it and started poking around and learned that the MP happens to be available in black paint. Whaddaya know? Of course they&#8217;re always backordered everywhere and I was told the wait time was in _months_. So much for an impulse purchase. Whew!

So for a few days I put a few rolls through the M3 and M6 and was reminded how much fun it could be. But wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to be the original owner of a new Leica M? I&#8217;ve been told by people who know me and have been around me that I should &#8220;Never sell a Leica!&#8221;. What better way to make sure that happens than to have a new one I can call my own forever?

And the rationalizations continued for a week or so while I absorbed every review, forum post, and YouTube video I could find that contained even a whiff of information about the MP.

I love film. I want to always shoot film. So I called [Leica Store Miami][3] and put myself on the waiting list for a black paint MP. I was told they only receive new ones every couple of months, and the waiting list is pretty long, so I should settle in for a long wait. And who knows, maybe I&#8217;d lose interest in the meantime. It happens. Of course B&H, Leica, and the other usual outlets were backordered as well.

Then, on a whim, I looked for one at [Camera West][4]. I&#8217;ve purchased from them before and had good luck. You know what happens next, right? They had 2 new black paint MPs in stock. I bought one immediately.

So that happened.

The camera arrived today and I&#8217;ve never seen anything so beautiful. It&#8217;s perfect. It&#8217;s new, warrantied, flawless, and mine. My long bet on film begins today.
