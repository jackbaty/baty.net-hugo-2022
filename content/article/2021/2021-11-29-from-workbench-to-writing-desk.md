I put together a workbench in my basement office that was supposed to house all of the cool &#8220;maker&#8221; projects I was planning. You know, little electronic builds, equipment repair, that sort of thing. I&#8217;ve come to realize that these projects are infrequent and the workbench space is mostly wasted.

I&#8217;ve found myself occasionally standing at the bench to write in my notebook or read a magazine, just as a chance to stand up for a while. I haven&#8217;t had an adjustable-height desk since leaving Fusionary, and I enjoy standing.

So, I removed most of the workbenchy stuff and replaced it with pens and inks and notebooks. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll actually need a workbench, but for now it works better as a writing desk.
