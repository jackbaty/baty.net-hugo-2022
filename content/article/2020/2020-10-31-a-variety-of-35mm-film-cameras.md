<!--kg-card-begin: html-->Here are my remaining 35mm SLR film cameras. Clockwise from front-left, they are.

**Canon AE-1 Program**. An AE-Program was my first real camera. I received one &nbsp;from my parents as a graduation gift. Today, though, it&#8217;s my least favorite. It just doesn&#8217;t _feel_ good to use.

**Nikon F100**. This might be the single greatest deal there is when it comes to film cameras. These are semi-professional, high-end cameras that sold for around $1,400 (In 1999 dollars. One would cost more than $2,100 today). These can now be found for under $300. Great cameras.

**Canon EOS-1v**. The 1v was the best film camera Canon ever made. Or _will_ ever make. It&#8217;s a solid, water-resistant, workhorse brick of a camera. I think if I were forced to keep just one SLR this would be it (with the F100 a close second).

**Nikon F3**. In production for nearly 20 years, the F3 is was a professional staple for as long as any camera I can think of. Mine is in great shape and works well, but I&#8217;m not in love with it. I can&#8217;t put my finger on the problem, but I never seem to reach for it other than to be sure and run a roll or two through it each year.

**Olympus OM-1n**. What a wonderful little jewel this is. And by little I mean _little._ Just look at it compared to the others. My copy is interesting because it came in a box of gear I bought on Craigslist. It was all dented and bent and basically unusable. The guy I bought it from said that it had literally fallen into a volcano (he was a geologist). I had a local camera repair shop attempt to fix it, and they did. It works great still today. The OM-1n has one of the biggest, brightest viewfinders I&#8217;ve ever used. I love it. I wish it didn&#8217;t use mercury batteries, though. I&#8217;ll never get rid of this one. I used to have a couple of the later OM-2ns and often consider picking up another.

I&#8217;ve been thinking of selling some of them. Instead, I&#8217;ve been loading them up with various films and shooting with them. It&#8217;s been so much fun that I&#8217;ve changed my mind and I&#8217;ll be keeping everything. At least for now.
