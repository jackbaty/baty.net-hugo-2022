<!--kg-card-begin: html-->Film photography is a lot of work. Not so much the actual shooting part, that&#8217;s work no matter what the medium, but lately I find the rest of the process (developing, scanning, storing) to be more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.

Thing is, I enjoy spending time in the darkroom, processing film. It&#8217;s meditative; the perfect hobby for an introvert. I have various wonderful old cameras, which are often reason enough to shoot film. But is it worth the trouble?

If forced, I must admit that I like being seen as a &#8220;film photographer.&#8221; It makes me feel like I&#8217;m in a group separate from the masses. I like being an outlier.

The trouble, I&#8217;m finding, is that I don&#8217;t really like the results I&#8217;m getting. I&#8217;ve shot maybe 20 rolls of film this year and a couple dozen large format negatives. Not a ton, but I&#8217;ve gone through them and there are only a handful that I really like, and most of those I only like because of their _filminess._ 

By &#8220;filminess&#8221; I mean grainy, blurred or otherwise odd in some way that screams &#8220;I&#8217;m not an iPhone photo!&#8221; Is that really the characteristic I&#8217;m going for?

I look at a lot of film photographs on social media. I&#8217;ve begun noticing that they&#8217;re often not very good. Aside from the fact that they were made on film, they&#8217;d be entirely forgettable. A lot of the images look like nothing more than an excuse to use a cool camera or a way to finish the roll.

In fact, this attitude is what I see in my photos, and I don&#8217;t like it.

As usual, I&#8217;m overthinking things, but the infrastructure I have amassed in order to ease the process of shooting film is ridiculous. If the results were better, I wouldn&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;m tired of getting to the end of the long, sometimes tedious and difficult process only to look at the images and think, &#8220;meh.&#8221;<figure class="wp-block-image size-large kg-card kg-image-card">

Film photography is a wonderful hobby, but maybe I need a little break from it.
