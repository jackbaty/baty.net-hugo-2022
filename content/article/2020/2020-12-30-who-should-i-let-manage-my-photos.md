<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I have for many years kept my photos properly named and in a dated folder hierarchy on my hard drive: 

`/2020/12-December 2020/2020-12-02-Alice.dng`

This requires that I import my photos from a card, then add metadata (Title and Caption), then rename them with the capture date and title, then put them into the proper folder, where they live forever. Whew!

Another step later in my process is to &#8220;burn&#8221; a copy of each edited RAW file to a JPEG that lives right beside the original. I also create a copy of the best photos in my &#8220;Digital Print Archive&#8221;. The DPA is swept up and uploaded to Google Photos, Flickr, and my Synology, automatically. This gives me ways to share and organize them later. It also provides the content-based search and face recognition that is so handy.

It&#8217;s a good system. Solid. Future-proof. Backups are a known quantity.

But I&#8217;m tired of doing it. I&#8217;m tired of copying, moving, renaming, archiving, burning, etc. Basically I&#8217;m tired of managing everything myself. I edit my RAW files in Capture One Pro and deal with culling, naming, and distributing using Photo Mechanic. They&#8217;re great apps, but expensive and so flexible that I spend way too much time tweaking my process.

Some days, today for example, I&#8217;m tempted to import everything into the new Lightroom and let Adobe take it from there. This battle has been raging for a few years now and I cannot for the life of me settle it.

The truth is, Lightroom can be configured to keep all of the original RAW files on a local drive, in dated folders, automatically. This helps alleviate my fear of going all-in with cloud storage. I can&#8217;t rename files from within Lightroom, but at least I know they&#8217;re _there_. I&#8217;ve tried importing, culling, renaming in Photo Mechanic and _then_ importing into Lightroom, but if I&#8217;m going to bother with all that I should just stick with C1.

Lightroom isn&#8217;t even close to Capture One on features, power, or flexibility. But it syncs my photos to all my devices, including my iPhone photos. I don&#8217;t have to do anything. That&#8217;s a huge benefit. 90% of my images can be processed just fine in Lightroom. If I want, I can always process the other 10% using Capture One (or Photoshop, I suppose).

This post is just me trying to talk myself into yielding to my lazier tendencies and moving everything to Lightroom. I&#8217;m still noodling on it, but don&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s a new post soon about how I switched to Lightroom (again). Maybe then I&#8217;ll spend more time photographing and less time playing with my editing workflow.
