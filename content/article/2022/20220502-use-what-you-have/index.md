I have some pretty nice things. I'm fortunate and have more "stuff" than I could ever need. And yet, it seems as if I'm always buying something new. It's just that I like to try new things, whether it's tools, software, gadgets, or what have you. I want to see what different things feel like to have and use.

The photo above is from my dad's garage, taken this year. I took it because I'm always amazed at how little it changes. My dad rarely buys anything new. He just uses what he has.

Recently, I have been striving to be more like my dad. Whenever I start looking for some new thing to help me do some old thing, I say to myself, "Use what you have!" It's working pretty well. I have not purchased anything new if I already have something similar that will do the job. No gadgets, cameras, pens, notebooks, computers, etc. I already have all those things, and they work great.
