When I was a kid I kept a small, fresh-water aquarium. It was fun, but I always knew that the really cool fish lived in salt water. Fast forward 40 years or so and I’ve finally put together a salt-water “reef” aquarium.
I’ve started small because there seems to be quite a percentage of people who bail on them within the first year or so. I want to be sure it sticks before spending tons of money and going all-in.
I went with the “beginner” BioCube 32. I set the tank up the first week of June. Added “live” rock and sand. “Aquascaping” the aquarium was fun. I think I have a configuration that looks nice and also leaves plenty of nooks and crannies for critters to hide in. I added a powerhead pump for better flow, and waited. I had to buy water!

New tanks need to go through an initial [Nitrogen cycle](https://www.thebeginnersreef.com/fish-tank-nitrogen-cycle-step-by-step-explanation/) before adding any fish or corals. This can take four to six weeks. Using [live rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_rock) and sand helps move it along. I impatiently tested my water for Ammonia and Nitrites every day or two, and after just two weeks it was ready.

I added my first fish, an [Ocellaris Clownfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocellaris_clownfish), on July 3rd. Clowns are nearly everyone’s first fish. They’re cool and easy to care for, so why not? And who doesn’t love [Nemo](https://letterboxd.com/film/finding-nemo/)? Mine is a “designer” Black Clown. We named him “Marcus” for no particular reason.

Here he is in my tank:

Isn’t he cute! (All clowns are born male…and cute).
Since Marcus seemed to be doing well, I added another fish yesterday: A [Bicolor Blenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecsenius_bicolor). We named this one “Benny”. (I know).

I haven’t taken a photo of him yet because he’s still hiding in a hole on the rocks. I did take a snap while acclimating him. Acclimation involves slowly dripping water from the aquarium into his water from the local fish store ([Water Colors Aquarium Gallery](https://watercolorsaquariumgallery.com/))

I also added a couple of Astrea snails in anticipation of algae growth. I’ll need a lot more of these eventually.

So far, so good. There’s a lot to learn about keeping a reef tank. Water parameters are critical, especially with coral. I can’t wait to start adding coral! There are feeding issues, cleaning, filtering, diseases, livestock problems, and on and on. It’s awesome so far. I love fish!
