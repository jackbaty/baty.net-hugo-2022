The [Leica SL series][1] of cameras are special, but not unique. I had an original SL and then bought the SL2-S when it was released. It&#8217;s a capable, well-built, beautiful camera. But, if I&#8217;m being honest, it&#8217;s just another mirrorless camera system. And it was very expensive. Purchased today, my kit, consisting of the SL2-S and the Leica APO Summicron 35mm and 75mm lenses would run close to $16,000. Um, who do I think I am?

I thought I&#8217;d shoot more video with it but haven&#8217;t. I thought I&#8217;d do more portraits with it, but I haven&#8217;t. Hell, I thought I&#8217;d _use_ it a lot, but I haven&#8217;t.

So, I sold it all.

Leica&#8217;s menu systems are wonderfully simple. The SL2-S feels like a tank. Its EVF is far and away the best I&#8217;ve ever looked through. The images are terrific. It _feels_ good in my hands. On top of that, the APO-Summicron-SL 35mm lens is the greatest lens I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of using. I mean it. I&#8217;d often unload a card and actually say, &#8220;Wow!&#8221;.

All that great stuff is great stuff, but I still wasn&#8217;t using the camera enough, and I felt guilty having that much money in camera gear just idling in a camera bag. As I said, it&#8217;s really just a (very nice) mirrorless system. I could pick up a used Nikon Z or Canon R or Fuji kit for much less and get basically the same features and capabilities, if not the same _experience_.

The other factor that weighed on me was that I missed the M10-R. I know, I know, I _just_ sold an M10-R to fund the Q2 Monochrom. Here&#8217;s what I said about that move only a month ago:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The M is a slow, manual-focus, deliberate camera. It&#8217;s not really suited for just having around taking snaps. It only focuses down to like three feet. Manual focus means that every shot requires two hands. It&#8217;s very very expensive, so letting it just dangle around my neck while not paying attention to it is a terrible idea.

</blockquote>

All that is still true, but now I have the Q2M for &#8220;just dangling around my neck&#8221; when I&#8217;m out and about. What the M10-R offers is the Leica M shooting experience. It&#8217;s a beautiful, iconic, delightful rangefinder camera. The Leica M series of cameras fit perfectly in my hands and my brain, even if they&#8217;re &#8220;harder&#8221; to use.

Plus, I can now focus on one system and use the fantastic M lenses that I&#8217;ve loved for so long. And everything works exactly the same on my film Ms, which reduces a lot of mental overhead.

I&#8217;ll miss the SL, and maybe one day I&#8217;ll end up with an SL3 or whatever, but I have to admit that right now it&#8217;s good for my brain to only deal with one camera and lens system again.
