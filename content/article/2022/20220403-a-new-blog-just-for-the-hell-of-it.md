Here we are, running the show as a static blog, using Hugo. But why!? I suppose because I was bored and because it's fun.

Also because while tinkering with my [notes.baty.net](https://notes.baty.net) site I was reminded that I like the "[CodeIt](https://github.com/jackbaty/CodeIT)" theme that it uses. I thought I'd see how it felt to create a blog from scratch using my version of that theme. Turns out it felt pretty good, so here we are.

I grew tired of pushing against the weight of WordPress.  The inconvenience of maintaining a static blog seemed like a fair trade. The past couple of days, I have found myself happier dealing with the inconvenience.
