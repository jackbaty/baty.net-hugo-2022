**TL;DR**: [daily.baty.net][1].

You see, I have [a nice wiki][2], and for a couple of years, I have written a new entry in it (nearly) every day. These &#8220;daily notes&#8221; have been interspersed and interlinked with the rest of the wiki&#8217;s content. It works, but I don&#8217;t love it.

Writing in [TiddlyWiki][3] is fine. It&#8217;s super easy, but it&#8217;s also a little clunky, which quickly becomes friction. And the experience for visitors is weird if you&#8217;re not familiar with TiddlyWiki. Also, there&#8217;s no RSS feed. I sometimes consider this a feature, because it&#8217;s nice writing freely and knowing it&#8217;s not &#8220;going anywhere&#8221;. On the other hand, if I were someone wanting to follow along with me, I&#8217;d want a damn RSS feed.

So, I periodically waffle between writing my daily posts on the wiki and on a &#8220;real&#8221; blog. One thing that has kept me in the wiki is that I can easily link things from my daily notes posts to the more permanent entries. This helps build a network of links. I love the _idea_ of all this linking back and forth, but in practice, it&#8217;s not as useful as I&#8217;d hoped. TiddlyWiki works better when each distinct idea or thing is created as a separate &#8220;tiddler&#8221;. I&#8217;ll create a new tiddler about something, link to that something, and then transclude the tiddler in that day&#8217;s daily. And then I almost never actually _take advantage of_ all that work. So why bother? I mean, it&#8217;s not as if I&#8217;m trying to build some sort of [Zettlekasten][4] here.

I love writing in [Emacs][5] and keeping everything [formatted as Org-mode files][6]. I like [Hugo][7] for blogging and I like the way the rendered site looks. TiddlyWiki is easier overall but Emacs/Org/Hugo is more fun for me and I believe it results in a nicer experience for visitors.

All that to say I&#8217;m once again back to using a &#8220;real&#8221; blog for my daily notes. I&#8217;ve committed enough to this that I&#8217;ve added a link in the navigation here. You can follow along at [daily.baty.net][1]. 

An RSS feed for daily.baty.net is available both [on its own][8] and as part of my [Everything Feed][9].
