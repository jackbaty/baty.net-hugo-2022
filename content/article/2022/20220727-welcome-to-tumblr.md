As much as I, ehem, [LoveIt](/2022/loveit/), the theme's very theme-specific magic felt like trouble waiting to happen. And honestly, I was bored with it, so I went looking for something new.

I dislike modern blog themes. They all seem to think I want a giant hero image and way too much white space. Or that I'm selling something.

I knew I liked [the Bilberry theme](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme) as soon as I saw it. It's very Tumblr-esque, with its small, isolated posts and its post "types" for different kinds of content.

So I ported my content over, made a few tweaks, and here we are. You'll notice the lack of a "Journal" post each day. I haven't decided whether to spend the time implementing that or if I'll just go back to using daily.baty.net.
