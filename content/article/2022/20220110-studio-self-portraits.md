I finished a roll in the MP today by taking a bunch of self-portraits in my basement "studio".

The shots in which you can see both my hands were triggered by stepping on the release bulb. Clever! ðŸ™‚

I really like the look of these. They were shot in my basement with a new canvas backdrop. I used two Profoto strobes. One with a softbox (octogon) to camera left, and a second with a reflector at camera right pointing at the backdrop. I'm learning.
