I&#8217;ve been feeling a need to simplify things and I&#8217;ve decided that one of those things is my domain names. My days of hoarding domain names, just in case, are drawing to a close. I don&#8217;t want the hassle of managing a bunch of zones and I don&#8217;t need the fees.



To that end, I&#8217;m working toward moving everything to subdomains of [baty.net][1].



I&#8217;ve already moved my wiki from rudimentarylathe.wiki to [rl.baty.net][2]. I considered wiki.baty.net and may still use that instead.



Next up is [baty.blog][3]. Not sure if I&#8217;ll use blog.baty.net for that or not, yet.



And of course the website you&#8217;re reading now, baty.net, is once again a blog (WordPress) rather than a static landing page. I plan to move my &#8220;everything&#8221; RSS feed here, so keep an eye out for baty.net/everything



There are several others to move, and I&#8217;ll be sure to leave permanent redirects up and running at least until the domains expire. That should give Google time to catch up.



The domains I&#8217;m not sure about are the hosted services. This Write.as blog, for example. Currently, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll leave them where they are, without custom domains. That makes things simpler. I lose the opportunity to “own” the URLs but, as we all know, I&#8217;m prone to breaking links. Not my greatest feature, but it&#8217;s proven true.

The idea is to have as few moving parts and dependencies as is reasonable.
