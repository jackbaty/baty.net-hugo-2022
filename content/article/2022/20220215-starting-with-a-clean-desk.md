My home office environment was getting out of hand, clutter-wise. They say that a messy desk is the sign of a creative mind. Maybe so, but I&#8217;m more of a tidy desk person.

I&#8217;ll sometimes notice that I&#8217;m easily provoked, frustrated, or otherwise feeling edgy. Then I&#8217;ll clean my office and I _always_ feel better.

The worst thing for me is to set something on my desk because I don&#8217;t yet know where I&#8217;m going to put it. Then it just sits there, for weeks, nagging me out of the corner of my eye. Drives me nuts. Or, I&#8217;ll knock something over or cords will tangle or I&#8217;ll be unable to find something because it&#8217;s under something else. Aargh!

My workspace doesn&#8217;t need to be a minimalist, Instagram-worthy setup. It just needs to be organized and tidy. I cleaned my desk yesterday and have been in a better mood since. ðŸ‘‹
