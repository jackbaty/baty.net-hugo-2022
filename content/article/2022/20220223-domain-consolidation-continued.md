Remember when all I planned to do was to <a href="https://baty.net/2022/domain-consolidation/" data-type="post" data-id="20">put all of my blogs under one domain</a> and that was it? I&#8217;d still have all the same blogs, but they were going to live under a bunch of _something.baty.net_ subdomains. 

Well, I got carried away. I brought back baty.net as a blog (WordPress) and migrated all of my recent Write.as posts and imported everything from Copingmechanism.com. I am once again living at baty.net.

I&#8217;ll copy anything useful over from baty.blog and daily.baty.blog. I plan to shutter baty.blog but I may keep the daily blog around, just in case.

So let&#8217;s see, I now &#8220;only&#8221; have this blog at [baty.net][1], a microblog at [jack.micro.blog][2], and the wiki (aka Rudimentary Lathe) at [rl.baty.net][3]. It&#8217;s possible I may have just set a new personal record for having the fewest blogs at once.

Oh, and I moved my &#8220;Everything&#8221; RSS feed here too. Subscribe at [baty.net/everything][4].
