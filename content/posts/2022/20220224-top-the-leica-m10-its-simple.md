> There’s a shutter speed dial with “A” as an option. There’s a numbered ISO dial (so you can see where it’s set even when the camera’s off). There are apertures on a ring around the lens. You focus the camera and the focus stays where you put it until you change it.

This is why I love the Leica M so much. Everything is _right there_, all the time. I **never** futz with settings or customizing dials or wondering which sub-genre of focus modes I need and how I get them.

I also love that I can pop the tiny, jewel-like lens off my 2021 M10-R and slip it on my 1960 M3 and everything works exactly the same. It&#8217;s a beautiful, underappreciated thing.
