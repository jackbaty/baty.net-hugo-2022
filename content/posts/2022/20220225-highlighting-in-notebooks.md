One valid criticism of using paper for notes is that searching through notebooks is rather difficult. With my poor handwriting, scanning for certain information in a wash of squiggly lines can be painfully slow.

For a couple of months now I&#8217;ve been going back through my notes periodically and highlighting key words and phrases. I&#8217;ve found that if I emphasize the most relevant bit of each note, I can find most things fairly quickly. It also helps when simply perusing old notes. Usually, I want to skip anything &#8220;meta&#8221; like which pen I&#8217;m using or the regular &#8220;Why am I still using paper?&#8221; fluff. Zipping over the highlighted phrases makes quick work of it.

Someday this could also help with building an index. If I ever decide to bother, that is.

So yeah, highlighting my paper notes is useful and I recommend it. I wish I&#8217;d thought of it sooner.
