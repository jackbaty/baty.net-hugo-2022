I&#8217;m trying something new.

I’ve become a pretty heavy user of&nbsp;[Org-roam][1]&nbsp;for personal notes. I put nearly everything there now; technical notes, contact information, project notes, vendor info, etc. These notes are all nicely linked and backlinked and live in my main ~/org directory so I can easily find things right within Emacs.

A portion of these notes might be useful to other people. So I&#8217;m exporting the shareable notes from Org-roam as [Hugo][2]-compatible Markdown files. This turned out to be surprisingly easy. You can see the results at <https://notes.baty.net> and the [details of how it works][3] makes a good example.

I&#8217;m sure there are a dozen ways to do this, but this seems to work quite well.
