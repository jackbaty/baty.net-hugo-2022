I splurged on a new Apple Studio Display for my home office. It's only been 24 hours but I couldn't be happier. I wish it wasn't so expensive. Even the "base" model is too expensive. And no way I'm paying another $400 just so I can adjust the height. That pisses me off a little, but the display is gorgeous, so all is forgiven.

Here's why I bought one:

* My 32-inch LG was too big. I know that sounds crazy, but too much screen real estate is a distraction for me.
* I wanted 5k. Whenever I switched between the (4k) LG and my internal Retina MacBook Pro monitor, the difference when reading text was pronounced. Moving to the internal Retina display felt like putting on glasses.
* I wanted built-in speakers and camera. I keep the MBP in clamshell mode, so I needed to have extra speakers on my desk and didn't like the clutter.
* The hardware is beautiful. I stare at my monitor nearly all day, every day. The Studio Display is simply nicer looking than anything else I've seen. This alone doesn't justify the purchase, but it sure helps.

I've taken the LG to my temporary office in our old building, so it's not like it's going to waste. The new Studio Display is a great upgrade, though.
