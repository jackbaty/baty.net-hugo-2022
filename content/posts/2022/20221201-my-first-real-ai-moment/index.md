I just had my first real AI revelation moment while using [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). I asked it an honest question that I had and got a complete, sensible, and correct answer. It's like if Google had a brain, or if I asked an assistant to look something up for me and report back. Here's part of the thread:

Can you imagine where this leads? I didn't really _get_ it, until having the above conversation. I'd love being in high school right now. It's like being in that brief period where calculators were still rare, so having one was like cheating. AI feels like cheating, in a good way.
