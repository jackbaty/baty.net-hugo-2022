I've been on the Mastodon.technology instance for nearly 5 years. It's been great, but given the coming shutdown I needed to find a new instance.

I almost gave up on the whole Fediverse. After all, I've been on Twitter for nearly 20 years already. Never had to move or change anything. That's of course no guarantee, but you know. Plus, it's Twitter.

Anyway, I've settled on the [Fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org) instance. I'm not a 100% FOSS person, but I find that group to be interesting and "my people" so I'm hoping they forgive the occasional reference or recommendation around proprietary tools.

I'm [@jackbaty@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/web/@jackbaty) there.

Thanks, and best of luck to [Ash](https://masto.ashfurrow.com/@ashfurrow).
