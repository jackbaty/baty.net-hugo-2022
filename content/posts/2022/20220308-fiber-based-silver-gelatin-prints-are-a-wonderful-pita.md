I hate making fiber-based silver gelatin prints in the darkroom. But I _love_ having them to hold and to hang.

Fiber-based papers have this deep, magical sheen, and the surface is smooth yet has a distinct, subtle texture that is missing from resin-coated (RC) papers.

Compared to RC papers, fiber-based paper takes twice as long to process. It requires additional washing and optional toning steps. It eats up fixer and takes more trays than I have comfortable room for. It must be washed for up to an hour. And then there&#8217;s the curling, so I have to press the prints under heavy books for a few days before I can do anything with them

Just look at this example. It&#8217;s ridiculous.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I gave up on fiber a few years ago, but have been having second thoughts. A fiber print _feels_ so good in hand. Heavy, smooth, and solid, somehow. And there&#8217;s no escaping how great they look. I&#8217;ve been asking myself if maybe it&#8217;s worth the trouble after all. I made a few prints this week and yes, it is definitely worth the trouble.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
