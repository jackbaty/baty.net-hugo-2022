My wife bought an awful, kitschy plastic lamp and set it on one of the floor speakers. I, of course, balked.

That was a week ago and somehow the lamp is still there. I hate the lamp, but I don&#8217;t mind the light that it throws against the wall, and my wife loves it and thinks &#8220;it&#8217;s adorable&#8221;. Who am I to judge?

I took a photo of it. It&#8217;s just another boring snapshot by a film photographer looking for excuses to finish the roll. It&#8217;s exposed the way I intended and it&#8217;s composed nicely, but it&#8217;s not a great photo. I love it anyway.

I love the photo because it makes me smile. It makes me smile because I love my wife and it reminds me of one of the many reasons why. That&#8217;s the best kind.
