I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll ever be capable of sustaining an ongoing “meditation practice”.

The idea of regular meditation is compelling, but after many attempts I&#8217;m starting to think it may never stick. This is likely because I&#8217;ve not practiced long or consistently enough, but my brain just refuses to stay quiet or focused.

Instead, I&#8217;ve been making daily drawings. Or, more precisely, “doodles”. I find that mindlessly drawing random or repeating patterns soothes me. It&#8217;s a relaxing form of perhaps, if not meditation, mental relaxation. And calling them doodles helps me to avoid the feeling that they are “bad” drawings. It doesn&#8217;t matter.

Drawing may not have the consciousness-altering effect of consistent meditation, but it helps clear my head and lets my mind breathe a little.
