I dug out the big Linhof today and made a few self-portraits.

The setup was my usual: painted backdrop with two Profoto strobes, one through a octogon box and one with a small modifier on the background. I mostly wanted to test my new digital camera scanning setup. I think it worked pretty well.

This is what the "studio" looked like while setting things up.
