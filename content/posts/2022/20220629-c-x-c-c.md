I rage-quit Emacs this morning. By that, I don’t mean that I hit C-x C-c really hard, although I did do that. I mean I stopped using Emacs.

<!--more-->

I have spent so much time this past week futzing with my Emacs config. And then futzing with my note-taking process in Emacs. And then reading articles about how other people futz with these things. It occurred to me that I’ve not done much of anything else. So I quit.
Emacs is worse for me than other software because it’s too damn good at too many things. This sounds like a stupid reason to stop using Emacs, and it kind of is, but I need a break from living neck-deep in it. I need a change in venue.

What usually happens is that after a couple of weeks (sometimes days), I miss it. I miss that it does nearly everything and what it doesn’t do I can make it do, with just a few days of venturing down various rabbit holes. It’s those rabbit holes that get me. I’m trying to avoid that right now. And around it goes.

So, for now, I’ll edit text in BBEdit or (gasp!) Vim (an excuse to try the new v9). I’ll keep tasks in Things. I’ll write notes in TheBrain. Everything else I’ll just stop doing, I guess.

“But did you really quit?” you ask. I know, we’ve been here many times before. But yes, for the moment, I’m going to take a break from Emacs (and :sniff: Org-mode). I have to quit cold turkey or I just keep going back. Let’s see how long it lasts this time.

**Update July 06, 2022**: It lasted almost a week.
