I'm moving this blog from Hugo to WordPress over the next day or two. I've had my fill of using SSGs for publishing and I need a change of pace. We've been here before&#x2026;several times. The RSS feed will change from `/index.xml` to `/feed/`. I'll be sure to add a redirect. See you on the other side!
