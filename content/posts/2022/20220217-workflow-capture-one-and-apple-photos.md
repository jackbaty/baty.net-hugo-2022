I&#8217;ve gone through many photographic workflows. Each time, I&#8217;m certain that I&#8217;ve figured out what works best for me. Finally! Then a few months later I switch back or come up with something new. I wish I would stop doing this, but I probably never will.

So, I have a new workflow ????

There is a part of me that really wants to let Adobe deal with everything. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if I didn&#8217;t have to organize, store, back up, or otherwise manage tens of thousands of image files? I could just use Lightroom (desktop) and let the cloud take over the rest. Except I can&#8217;t. I have proven myself incapable of giving up control over the files. I have decades of images stored in nicely-organized, dated folders. I know where they are. I know how to back them up. It feels safe forever.

Also, I can&#8217;t stop returning to Capture One Pro. Lightroom Classic has everything I could ever need, workflow and management-wise, but I prefer actually editing in C1. And I prefer the results I get with Capture One.

I like to &#8220;burn&#8221; a finished JPEG of every image that I&#8217;ve spent any time editing. That way, if (when?) whatever processing software I&#8217;m using disappears, I&#8217;ll still have the finished image. I&#8217;ve treated these JPEGs in a couple of ways. I&#8217;d either send them to what I called a &#8220;Digital Print Archive&#8221; which was just dated folders. Or, I&#8217;d make the copy right &#8220;next to&#8221; the original. Either way, I ended up with _two_ files to manage for each photo. 

Previously, to handle all of this, I used a complex combination of Capture One and Photo Mechanic to cull, tag, and otherwise deal with my library and set of burned JPEGs. It was pretty powerful, but it was a pain to maintain.

I wanted to simplify things a bit, so I&#8217;m now using only Capture One and Apple Photos. I import, cull and edit photos in a Capture One &#8220;session&#8221;, then export the keepers directly to Apple Photos. Photos is where I make albums and such. It also gives me &#8220;faces&#8221; and syncs everywhere. Plus, all the photos I take with my phone are right there with everything else.

I&#8217;ve done something similar to this [before][1], of course, but I&#8217;m trying it again.
