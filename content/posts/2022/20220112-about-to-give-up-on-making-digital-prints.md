Late last year I printed a couple (black and white) photos, scanned from film negatives, on my Canon Pixma Pro-100 inkjet printer and I loved them. &#8220;There! I&#8217;ve finally figured it out!&#8221;, I said at the time.

Today, I thought I&#8217;d make a couple more prints, also from black and white film scans. The difference was that I have a new computer and never copied the ICC profiles for my paper. I spent a few minutes installing the profiles, made sure the Canon driver was up to date, fired up Photoshop, loaded the printer with [Canson Platine Fibre Rag][1] paper, and hit &#8220;Print&#8221;.

The resulting print was horrible. It was weak, low-contrast, pale, and lifeless. Sigh. Let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;d selected &#8220;Black and White&#8221; in the printer setup, so maybe I didn&#8217;t use to do that. I sent another print. This one was worse. Much worse. It was blue.

Since I normally would print from Lightroom, I fired that up and tried again. Better, but still pale and lifeless. OK, let&#8217;s try one from Lightroom set to &#8220;Black and white&#8221;. Much better. I can&#8217;t put my finger on it, but it&#8217;s still not great. Doesn&#8217;t have that smooth sparkle I was getting last time. You can see all four versions here:<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Anyway, it seems that getting decent prints out of my inkjet printer is a crapshoot. I&#8217;ve never been able to get consistent, pleasing results. I&#8217;ll spend a little more time trying to document what I&#8217;m doing and try a systematic approach to figuring it out, but at some point I&#8217;m just going to throw my hands up and head back into the darkroom.
