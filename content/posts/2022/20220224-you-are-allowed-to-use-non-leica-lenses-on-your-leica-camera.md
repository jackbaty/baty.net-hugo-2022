All too often someone on a forum or blog will claim that the only reason to even _have_ a Leica is to use Leica&#8217;s lenses. Hogwash! While certainly a fine reason, it&#8217;s nothing close to the only reason. The idea that one should never use non-Leica lenses on their Leica is nonsense.

I have a few very nice Leica M lenses. I love them and they are my favorites. But I also have some non-Leica lenses in both LTM and M mounts. They&#8217;re fun and interesting and unique. They offer a different look than the Leica lenses. Mine are old, and nowhere near as technically capable as the stuff Voigtlander has been putting out recently. I don&#8217;t want those, anyway. I already have all the sharpness and micro-contrast and &#8220;pop&#8221; I can handle. I put older lenses on my M because it gives the photos a different feel. It can be nostalgic. Sometimes an image works better when it&#8217;s a little softer and has a smidge less contrast.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Whether you also own Leica lenses or not, go ahead and slap whatever you want on your camera and have fun.
