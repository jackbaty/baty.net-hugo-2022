<!--kg-card-begin: html-->When I 

[bought a used Leica SL(601) recently][1] instead of the newer SL2 , it was mostly because I didn&#8217;t want to spend $6,000 on a camera that I wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d love. But it was also _partly_ because I really don&#8217;t need a 47-megapixel sensor. Who&#8217;s got the time and space to manage 80MB per image photos?

I&#8217;ve had the SL for a month and that&#8217;s long enough to know that I love it. It&#8217;s big but not too big. It&#8217;s an absolute tank, build-wise, and it&#8217;s fast and fun to use. I&#8217;m happy. I can shoot my M-mount Leica lenses on it and am finding it even easier to focus them on the SL than I do on the M10-P. So everything&#8217;s good then. I wish it had IBIS, though.

And then, just this morning, [Leica announced the SL2-S][2]. The SL2-S is, from my standpoint, an updated SL that adds everything in the SL2 except the giant sensor. The SL2-S has a 24 Megapixel sensor, which is a sweet spot for me. It also improves focusing, low-light capabilities, and of course includes IBIS. In other words, it&#8217;s exactly what I wanted in the SL2. And to top it off, it&#8217;s more than $1,000 _cheaper_ than the SL2.

Apparently the SL2-S is being marketed as a hybrid still/video powerhouse. I guess the video features are great, but I don&#8217;t care as much about that. I care about speed, handling, image quality, and reasonable file sizes. Proper video is a nice bonus, though.

I&#8217;ve already sold my beloved M10-P and preordered an SL2-S. I have no idea when it&#8217;ll arrive, but I can hardly wait.
