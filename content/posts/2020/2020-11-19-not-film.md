<!--kg-card-begin: html-->To make this simple self-portrait, I didn&#8217;t spend an hour setting up the Wista, loading sheets of film, processing with half-expired C-41 chemistry, crossing my fingers, drying, scanning, spotting, inverting, storing, and on and on.

Instead, I set a digital camera on a tripod and triggered the shutter with my iPhone. The whole thing from idea to upload took less than 10 minutes.

I used to look at a shot like that on film, amazed that I hit focus and got the color somewhere close to what I remembered and there weren&#8217;t any distracting dust spots or light leaks or water spots. Thing is, it&#8217;s really just a boring selfie. But if it was on film it would have taken more work and therefore have more intrinsic value built in, right?

I used to think so, but I&#8217;m starting to wonder if maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter to me anymore.
