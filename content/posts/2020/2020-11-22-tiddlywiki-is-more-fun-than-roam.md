<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I fell in love with 

[TiddlyWiki][1] [almost exactly 2 years ago][2]. I wrote in it almost daily until [late August, 2020][3], when I moved full-time into a public [Roam][4] database.

Roam is great and I love it. I’ve tried everything else, and nothing beats Roam for easily taking, linking, and re-using notes. I’m still using a private Roam database for work projects and CRM-type stuff, and it’s great for that.

Roam is efficient, fast, clever…and boring. Easy isn’t the same as fun.

TiddlyWiki is _fun_. It’s playful. I can’t really explain it, but creating new “tiddlers” and messing around with customization and finding new organizing principles is actually enjoyable in TiddlyWiki. I am probably one of only a handful of people who actually prefer the separate view and edit modes.

So, I’m going to return to using TiddlyWiki instead of Roam for my daily notes and scraps. My wiki is still at [rudimentarylathe.org][5], which is a thousand times more fun as a URL than `https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jackbaty` am I right? I expect Roam will offer custom domains at some point, but so for they don’t.

I feel that TiddlyWiki’s local-first, single HTML file, free and open-source approach is better suited as a place to do “public self-modeling” for the long term.

Plus, it’s more fun. I hope to [see you there][5]!
