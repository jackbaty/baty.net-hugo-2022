This is only a test of the new "cover captions" feature of the latest [Congo theme release (2.5.0)](https://github.com/jpanther/congo/releases/tag/v2.5.0). Congo is clever about how it handles post images, but there was no way to include a caption for featured (aka cover) images on a post. Now there is, as you can tell (assuming the blog still uses Congo when you're reading this).
