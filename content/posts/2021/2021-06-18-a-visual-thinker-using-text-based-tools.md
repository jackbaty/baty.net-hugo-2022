<!--kg-card-begin: html-->Yesterday I was asked something about a project I&#8217;d worked on two years ago. At that time I&#8217;d used 

[Curio][1] to help manage the project. I opened the Curio project and within thirty seconds of just looking at the workspace I had a handle on the project and easily found an answer to the questions I&#8217;d been asked.

Whenever I revisit something that I&#8217;d created in [TheBrain][2] or a mind map or Curio or [Tinderbox][3], I find the spatial layout of the information to be instantly useful.

And yet I use [Org mode][4] in Emacs for nearly everything. You can probably tell that I&#8217;m having another one of my moments.

I love plain text. Or maybe it&#8217;s more accurate to say that I love the _idea_ of plain text. Nearly all the arguments for using plain text are good arguments, but that doesn&#8217;t make plain text any more _useful_ for me.

Plain text&#8217;s usefulness depends on what it&#8217;s _for_. As an example, a simple log of things that happen throughout the day makes sense as plain text. It&#8217;s almost always going to be accessed via search, and text is made for searching. Journaling can be done in plain text, although it&#8217;s made better by including images.

The way text is presented can make all the difference. An example is the display of backlinks in Roam and Logseq. Those tools use a nicely-formatted display, including context. Compare it to something like org-roam, which, as powerful as it is, can&#8217;t compete visually. It&#8217;s hard to parse backlinks in org-roam just by looking at them. And that&#8217;s a problem system wide. A wall of text is less useful than a purposefully-arranged and formatted visual display of that same information.

Anyway, I launched Curio and Tinderbox and TheBrain and now I&#8217;m in big trouble.
