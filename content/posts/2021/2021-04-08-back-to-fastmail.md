<!--kg-card-begin: html-->My first annual subscription to Basecamp&#8217;s 

[HEY][1] email service is about to expire, meaning it&#8217;s time to decide whether I will be renewing.

I don&#8217;t think I will.

This makes me sad, because I really like using HEY for email. They&#8217;ve done a great job re-thinking how we interact with email and most of their decisions have been spot on.

I forward baty.net email from [Fastmail][2] to my HEY account and, now that they support SMTP forwarding, I can reply from there as well. Soon, they are likely to fully support custom domains, meaning I could move jack@baty.net directly into HEY and be done with it.

And that&#8217;s where I have a problem. Email is the most important account I have. It&#8217;s the key to everything. HEY is not &#8220;normal&#8221; email. There&#8217;s no access to it via the standard IMAP interface or even POP3.

One of the reasons I like HEY is that I _can&#8217;t_ change email clients. This is nice, because it means I&#8217;m not wasting time looking for the perfect tool. I just use HEY&#8217;s apps and that&#8217;s settled then. I trust Basecamp, but with HEY they control my email and it&#8217;s in a sort of black box, with no access to it outside of HEY&#8217;s own clients. This gives me hives and I&#8217;m not sure I can learn to be comfortable with it, despite appreciating the constraints.

Another factor is that I&#8217;m planning to move my wife&#8217;s email away from its current host and going to HEY might be too big a leap for her, workflow-wise. I can add her to my Fastmail account for $30/year where a new HEY account would be another $99.

I&#8217;ve got a couple weeks to decide, but right now I&#8217;m leaning toward sticking with a known, safe, stable quantity: Fastmail.
