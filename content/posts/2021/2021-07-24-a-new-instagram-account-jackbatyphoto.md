<!--kg-card-begin: html-->First, I have to admit that I&#8217;m not a fan of Instagram. Viewing tiny little photos on tiny little phones fed to us between advertisements in an order defined by a giant anti-privacy, disinformation-spreading corporation is the worst way to enjoy photography.

But, Instagram is where photographers are and I kind of want to be there, too. I want to focus on only photography (rather than socializing with friends and family) so I&#8217;ve created a new account to do just that: [JackBatyPhoto][1]. So, go ahead and &#8220;smash that Follow button&#8221; or whatever it is we&#8217;re doing now.
