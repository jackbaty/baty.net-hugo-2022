<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I&#8217;m exhausted. I think it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t been working in more than a month and my brain has had too much free time to &#8220;figure stuff out.&#8221; (Yes, I know how it sounds to complain about exhaustion while not having a job!)

As an experiment, I&#8217;m going to live the month of May in &#8220;Easy Mode&#8221;. This means I&#8217;m going to solve problems with quick, obvious, _easy_ solutions. I&#8217;m going to use the easy-to-use tools. And I&#8217;m going to make various processes as easy as possible.

Examples? Sure!

  * Roam not Emacs
  * Lightroom CC not Photo Mechanic and Capture One
  * Things not Org mode
  * Day One not Org Journal
  * WordPress&nbsp;not Hugo
  * Streaming music not FLAC/MP3 files
  * Netflix not Plex
  * Books not Kindle
  * Walks not Workouts
  * Mac not Linux

It could be argued that some of these are backwards, but this is where I&#8217;m starting, and the gist is: nothing fancy for a while.
