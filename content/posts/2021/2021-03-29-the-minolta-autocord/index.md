I&#8217;ve had this Minolta Autocord for so long I don&#8217;t remember where I got it. Or when, exactly.

Mine is a model RG-2 from 1962 with the Optiper-MVL shutter. I don&#8217;t know much else about the camera other than it&#8217;s fun but challenging to use. I keep thinking about taking it out for a spin but haven&#8217;t done that in a few years.

There&#8217;s more info about the Autocord at [camera-wiki.org][1]


Here&#8217;s an example from the camera. It&#8217;s me trying a self-portrait while wearing Mario jammies of course.

And then there&#8217;s this crazy thing&#8230;<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
