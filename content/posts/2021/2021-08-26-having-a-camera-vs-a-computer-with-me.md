A friend of mine mocked me for carrying a camera around my neck and I said, &#8220;I like to always have a camera with me.&#8221; and he held up his phone and said, &#8220;I always have a camera with me, too, see?&#8221; and I asked, &#8220;Does it take film?&#8221; and he laughed and said, &#8220;No, of course not.&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Then you don&#8217;t have a camera with you. You have a computer that can record images.&#8221; and I&#8217;m kind of a dick I guess.
