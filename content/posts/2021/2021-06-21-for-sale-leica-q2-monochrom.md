I purchased the Leica Q2 Monochrom (new) from [Camera West][1] in February 2021. It’s in like new condition and has fewer than 600 shutter actuations. **Price is $5,100 net to me**. That’s a savings of $1,000 off the price of a new one.

I adore my [Leica Q2 Monochrom][2], so why am I selling it?

The Q2M is for sale because I miss the M10-P and can’t have both. I bough the Q because sometimes I just want autofocus, close-focus, macro, and the convenience of an EVF. I found that the SL2-S ticks all those boxes, so the Q2M is really just an extravagant extra. As wonderful as it is, I don’t _need_ it. My loss is your gain.

The camera comes with original box, strap, battery, charger, cap, etc. If you want to know more about it, [email me][3].

**Update Jan 2022:** I bought another Q2M.
