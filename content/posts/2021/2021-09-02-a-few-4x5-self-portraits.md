<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I had the house to myself today, so I set up a backdrop and pulled out the strobes for a few large format film self-portraits using the Linhof.

These were all shot with the Linhof Master Technika on HP5 Plus, developed in HC-110 for 5 min (Dilution B) and scanned on the V750.<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
