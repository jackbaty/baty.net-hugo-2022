Let&#8217;s face it, film is meant for well-lit subjects.

Every time I bring a film camera to somewhere like a restaurant or a friend&#8217;s house, I regret it. There&#8217;s just never enough light for candid snaps.

I had an old roll of Delta 3200 in the fridge, so I thought I&#8217;d see if that helped.

It didn&#8217;t.

I like grain, but not _this_ much grain. Good grief.

I&#8217;ve printed a few from the roll, and a darkroom print at 5&#215;7&#8243; looks much better. Still, I think it makes more sense to bring a digital camera to places where I know I&#8217;ll struggle with light.
