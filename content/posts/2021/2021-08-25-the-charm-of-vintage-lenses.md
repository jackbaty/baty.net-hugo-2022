<!--kg-card-begin: html-->My Leica Elmar 9cm collapsible lens was made in 1957, making it nearly 70 years old, and it shows. The front element is hazy, causing images to be very low-contrast. Here&#8217;s an example (mounted on the SL2-S)&#8230;

It&#8217;s like a real-world Instagram filter and I don&#8217;t care for it. If it were in better condition, I might like the overall softer look for portraits.

I have a few other older lenses that I&#8217;ve almost accidentally collected over the years. There&#8217;s an Olympus OM 85mm f/2 which is wonderful and makes a good excuse for using my beat-up but adorable OM-1n. The Nikkor 105mm f/2.5 is legendary, (mostly because it was used by Steve McCurry to make the [Afghan Girl photo][2]), but I&#8217;m not blown away by it. I have a 1960s thread-mount Canon 50mm f/2.8 from 1958 and I like it for the IIIf but otherwise, it gets very little use.

Taking advantage of the &#8220;character&#8221; in old lenses is an attractive idea, but in practice, I gravitate toward &#8220;better&#8221; lenses. I made the photos of lenses in this post using the APO Summicron-SL 75mm and good lord what a lens. It&#8217;s hard to ignore the difference in technical quality and just let the old lenses charm me. Perhaps if I was going for a specific look for &#8220;my work&#8221; but mostly I&#8217;m just taking snapshots, so the charm of vintage lenses is often lost on me.

Still, I&#8217;m going to take the Elmar apart and clean that hazy front element and see where it gets me.
