My dream is to maintain my writing in one place. Unfortunately, I enjoy tinkering with different publishing tools so much that I have never been able to choose a single platform and stick with it.

I&#8217;m going to try focusing my writing here at copingmechanism.com for a while and see if I can live here. This means [baty.blog][1] is on hold for the time being.

One thing I wanted here was a theme that wasn&#8217;t quite so overwrought as &#8220;Hive&#8221;. I wanted something a little more old-school. I was poking around and found that James Vornov&#8217;s great blog, [On Deciding&#8230;Better][2], uses the Graphy WordPress theme, which I really like. I knew it seemed familiar because I had actually purchased the pro version of the theme back in April. And around we go!

The wildcard is my brand new blog at [daily.baty.net][3]. It&#8217;s managed using [Tinderbox][4]. I really enjoy using Tinderbox, but it remains to be seen if I will continue using it to generate a blog. I&#8217;m going to try copying the daily post from daily.baty.net into posts here at the end of each day. Maybe that&#8217;ll work well and I&#8217;ll switch to just using Tinderbox for writing and organizing each day, but not use it for the actual publishing process.

Still noodlin&#8217; on it. Thanks for playing along.
