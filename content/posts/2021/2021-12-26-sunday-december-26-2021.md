    Somehow, some part of their attention is directed toward the possibility that their application environment isn&#8217;t &#8220;ideal.&#8221; They have this notion there&#8217;s some perfect writing environment that will make them more productive or better writers by eliminating this thing called &#8220;distraction.&#8221; There&#8217;s some anxiety about the tool they&#8217;re using.

Dave&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ve gone through many iterations around &#8220;distraction-free&#8221; writing myself. In my case, though, I don&#8217;t do it because I feel the writing environment is holding me back. I do it because it can be fun to twiddle with tools. Same with cameras. My cameras have been better than my ability for years, but I still keep trying new cameras because I love cameras.

Oh, and about distraction-free writing in Tinderbox, I wrote&nbsp;[Tinderbox as a Minimalist Writing Environment][1]&nbsp;in 2013. (Unfortunately, all of the site&#8217;s images from 2012 were lost during one of many platform migrations.)

This week started out with the intention of building a Rails app, but ended with the creation of an entirely new Tinderbox Daybook and blogging system. You&#8217;re soaking in it. I&#8217;m still considering moving the whole enterprise to baty.blog and just living with that for a while. However, I still wonder about returning it to rudimentarylathe.org or maybe even replacing the photography domain copingmechanism.com. And who knows, I may end with all of this back in Emacs in a month. But Tinderbox is still super fun and powerful and let&#8217;s try it!

Tinderbox does this cool thing in outlines where the icon changes based on the age and size of each note. I&#8217;m working on mimicking that feature on the&nbsp;[Archives][2]&nbsp;page here. I&#8217;m a little lost when it comes to the new &#8220;functions&#8221; features in Tinderbox 9.1 so I fell back to adding some Action code as an Edict. Like this&#8230;

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>if ($TextLength&gt;500) {
    	$NoteIcon="long.png";
}
if ($TextLength&gt;50 & $TextLength&lt;=500) {
    	$NoteIcon ="medium.png";
}
if ($TextLength&lt;50) {
	$NoteIcon ="small.png";
}
if ($Image) {$NoteIcon = "cam.png"};</code></pre>

    Now, we all realize that our jump-off point is agreeing to rally the troops for next quarter so we can circle back to the perfect ROI for the inevitable year-end come-to-Jesus moment. That’s evident from our low-hanging fruit research and the blue-sky white papers presented by the team in marketing, right? NO, YOU’RE WRONG ON THAT, STEVE. STEVE. STEVE. HEAR ME OUT. YOU’RE WRONG. JUST HEAR ME OUT, STEVE.

I sometimes attend an event and take deliberate photos with a serious camera. Later, I see shots other people casually snapped with their iPhones or whatever and posted them (with no editing) directly to social media. They&#8217;re often much better than mine. Am I just wasting my time?

    This is how NFTs make me feel: like the future is useless but expensive, and world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.
