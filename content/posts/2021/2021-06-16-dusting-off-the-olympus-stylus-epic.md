I [bought my first Olympus Stylus Epic in 2004][1] and fell in love. I&#8217;ve owned one ever since. That original copy was [replaced in 2012][2] for $10, in the box, from a guy on Craigslist. Those days are gone. These little fellas have grown quite a following and fetch upwards of $300 on eBay. I&#8217;m not going to be paying that much once this one dies.

Mine has been collecting dust in a drawer for a year or two, which is a shame, so took it out today and loaded it with a roll of HP5+. No sense trying to preserve it, right?
