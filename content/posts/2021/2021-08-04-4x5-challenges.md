<!--kg-card-begin: html-->There are too many things that can go wrong when shooting large format (4&#215;5) film.

I made four exposures of my friends Steve and Bryan this afternoon. Two of the four were ruined right off the bat: The first, because I&#8217;d left the shutter open when pulling the dark slide. The second because I didn&#8217;t expose it at all and processed as though I had.

Large format is hard.

There are so many opportunities to fail that making a successful image is really quite rewarding. Today wasn&#8217;t a rewarding day. Both of the photos that weren&#8217;t completely ruined were spoiled in other ways.

The above image was taken while facing into the sun. That was dumb. I was so flustered after accidentally exposing the first negative that I basically ignored the actual subject of the shot.

And the following image shows some blooming/flair around the overexposed decking and table areas. I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s so severe. The lens may have been dirty.<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">

Oh well, I&#8217;ll just need to keep practicing because when it works, it&#8217;s awesome.
