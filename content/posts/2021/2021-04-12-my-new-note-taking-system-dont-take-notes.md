<!--kg-card-begin: html-->It feels like the entire world (or at least my corner of) is consumed by the &#8220;how&#8221; of note-taking. Tools, workflows, processes, backlinks, and on and on. Obsidian? Roam? Paper? I read it all. It&#8217;s fun and interesting and there&#8217;s no end of things to distract myself with. A distraction is all it is.

None if it really matters, though, and yet we endlessly split hairs and wring our hands and gaze at our navels over irrelevant minutiae. It&#8217;s exhausting. I&#8217;m not one of those people who wear &#8220;I never change my system&#8221; as a badge of honor. I can&#8217;t seem to stop. I&#8217;m too curious for that. FOMO and all.

As an attempt to extract myself from this loop, I&#8217;ve decided to stop taking notes for a while. This doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to stop writing. Writing isn&#8217;t note-taking. Nor is journaling. I&#8217;ll still do that. That&#8217;s what all of this is supposed to be _for_, isn&#8217;t it? But I won&#8217;t be jotting down my recent thoughts about minimalism or digital record-keeping or the details of a conversation I had with a colleague or how much I paid for the wrench I just ordered.

No more Roam vs Obsidian vs Tinderbox vs Org mode vs The Archive or what-have-you until I stop obsessing over which is better or more private or more open source or if it uses the right kind of Markdown. No more worrying about whether I&#8217;m taking &#8220;smart&#8221; enough notes or if this one should be &#8220;evergreen&#8221; or not. How long should a zettel be, anyway?

I&#8217;m willing to bet there are lots of smart, productive, happy people around that take very few notes and aren&#8217;t missing anything. I would love to be one of those people.
