<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I&#8217;ve been making 5&#215;7&#8243; prints for several years. I like small prints that are handy to toss around on the coffee table, are easily mounted in notebooks, and don&#8217;t take too much wall space (or storage).

But I also complain a lot about the problems with viewing tiny Instagram photos on a phone. &#8220;Too small!&#8221; I&#8217;d lament. It got me thinking about making larger prints. I don&#8217;t mean crazy 16&#215;20&#8243; monsters that eat up ink, paper, space, and money. I was thinking maybe 8&#215;10&#8243; would be a nice, larger change of pace.

I can only enlarge 35mm negatives in my current darkroom, meaning that for anything larger than that, I need to print digitally. So, I made a few (digital) prints on 8&#215;10&#8243; Canon photo paper with my 10-year-old Canon Pixma Pro-100 printer.

The prints look fine, but they don&#8217;t _feel_ good. They feel flimsy and cheap. It bugs me. I almost never mount and frame my prints, so I prefer something meatier. Something that handles better. You know, like a proper silver gelatin print on fiber paper. But, as I mentioned, my darkroom can&#8217;t do anything other than 35mm. Besides, making fiber darkroom prints is a ton of work, and reserved for only special images.

I want to print the more mundane stuff, too, but I don&#8217;t want the prints to _feel_ cheap, so I bought some [Canson Infinity Platine Fibre Rag Paper][1]. Wow, what a difference good ink jet photo paper makes.<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">

I installed the ICC profile from Canson for my printer and made a few test prints out of Lightroom. I really like them. Instead of going full-bleed borderless, I added a giant border on all four sides and added a narrow black border around the image itself. It may be a little gimmicky, but I think they look great and the border makes them easy to handle as well.

The actual image area ends up being only about twice the size of the 5&#215;7&#8243; prints, but bigger is better, and this is a good compromise between size, convenience, and cost.

Now to figure out how to make decent color prints
