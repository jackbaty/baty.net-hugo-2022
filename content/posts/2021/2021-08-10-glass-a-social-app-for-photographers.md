    For example, currently, we don’t have likes. If and when we launch a feature in that vein, it’ll be private. We’ve intentionally avoided any public counts. We don’t want Glass ever to become a popularity contest. We’re not home for influencers. We are a home for photographers.

Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to have a reasonable alternative to Instagram? I wish it could be Flickr, but I doubt that&#8217;ll ever happen.

Maybe [Glass][1] will have a shot. I&#8217;m number 482 on the waitlist so I&#8217;m about to find out.

**UPDATE August 12, 2021**: I&#8217;m in as @jbaty on Glass. I&#8217;ll play with it a bit and let you know what I think

**UPDATE August 14, 2021**: I like it. I don&#8217;t love it yet. It looks nice, but behaves in ways I don&#8217;t expect. It&#8217;s also froze on me a few times. I love the old-school Flickr feeling. I guess my problem is one that Glass can&#8217;t solve and that is I don&#8217;t like viewing photographs on a phone&#8217;s tiny screen.
