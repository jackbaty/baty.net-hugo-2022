Copingmechanism.com has alternated between being a general purpose blog and being a photography-only blog. It&#8217;s been mostly photography for months now, but I&#8217;m thinking of expanding the scope to include, well, everything I want to write about.

If I were a _real_ photographer, it might make sense to have a blog dedicated to &#8220;My Work&#8221; but I&#8217;m just a putterer. I&#8217;m guessing that very few people who visit this blog do so because it&#8217;s only about my photographs, and so they shouldn&#8217;t mind if I write about other things here as well. Let&#8217;s try it!
