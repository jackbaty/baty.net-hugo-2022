    Software-wise, this incredibly powerful iPad is as capable as a 2014 iPad Air 2 (the oldest iPad model that can run iPadOS 14). There is still, in my opinion, a substantial <em>software design</em> gap preventing iPads from being as flexible as they are powerful. Software-wise, iPadOS still lacks <em>flow</em>. Don’t wave Shortcuts in my face as a way of objecting. Shortcuts are a crutch. A good one, no doubt, but a crutch nonetheless. Software automation can do great things for an operating system, but if an operating system comes to <em>depend on it</em> to become usable, then maybe you have to rethink a thing or&nbsp;two.

&#8220;iPadOS still lacks flow&#8221;. Indeed, and that&#8217;s not all it lacks. I wish it were better.
