I'm trying to use up the rolls of expired TMAX 100 that have been taking up room in my fridge for a few years. I pulled the Nikon F3 out of a drawer, loaded batteries in the motor drive, and shot a roll. As usual, it was mostly photos of Alice and I around the house.

The film was processed in HC-110 (Dilution B) for six minutes and scanned on the V750. The first couple were shot using the vaunted Nikkor 105mm f/2.5 AI-s lens, for what that&#8217;s worth. The others were taken with the Nikkor 28mm f2.8 AI-s.

My love for the Nikon F3 has waned since the initial love affair, but once in a while it&#8217;s fun to clamp on the big motor drive and burn through a roll.


Here&#8217;s a photo of the F3 that I made with a Hasselblad.
