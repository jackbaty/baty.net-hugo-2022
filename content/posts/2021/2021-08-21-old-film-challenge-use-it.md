<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I was surprised to find that I had 55 rolls of various 35mm and 23 rolls of 120 negative film stocks just wasting away in my fridge. I mean, look at this treasure trove!

I&#8217;ve standardized on Ilford HP5 Plus for black and white film and Kodak Portra 400 for color. This doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t try something different occasionally, but those are my go-to films.

To make room, I&#8217;ve challenged myself to shoot all of this old stock before ordering any more new film. 

Here&#8217;s the 35mm inventory:

  * **Fujifilm Superia 400 Color**: 4 rolls
  * **Kodak Portra 400**: 10 rolls
  * **Kodak 400** (color): 5 rolls
  * **Ilford XP2**: 2 rolls (one is already in the Leica IIIf)
  * **Kodak Tri-X 400**: 5 rolls
  * **Kodak TMAX 100**: 7 rolls
  * **Kodak TMAX P3200**: 2 rolls
  * **Ilford Delta 3200**: 2 rolls
  * **Kodak 200** (color): 2 rolls
  * **Fujifilm Velvia 100**f: 1 roll
  * **Film Ferrania P30**: 1 roll
  * **Kodak Tri-X Pan**: 1 roll
  * **Kodak Technical Pan**: 1 roll
  * **Kodak Plus-X**: 1 roll

I may not bother shooting the very old stuff. For example, the Tech Pan expired in 1991! The Plus-X and Tri-X Pan are probably not far off from that. Plus, they&#8217;re in unopened boxes, which are worth keeping intact just for nostalgia&#8217;s sake.

And here&#8217;s the 120:

  * **Ilford Delta 100**: 7 rolls
  * **Kodak Portra 400**: 1 roll
  * **Fujifilm Provia 100f**: 2 rolls
  * **Kodak BW400CN**: 2 rolls
  * **Efke 25**: 1 roll
  * **Ilford Delta 3200**: 3 rolls
  * **Ilford Pan F 50**: 2 rolls
  * **Fujifilm Acros 100**: 3 rolls

There are 2 rolls of Astia but they&#8217;re 220 and I don&#8217;t have a back that will hold 220, so that&#8217;s out.

I was excited to see the Acros in there. It&#8217;s a great film.

It also looks like I&#8217;ll need to buy some E-6 chemistry for the Velvia and Provia.

If I&#8217;m being honest with myself, I understand that this is about three years&#8217; worth of film, given my normal pace. I&#8217;m hoping that this challenge will induce the feeling that I&#8217;ve got to hurry and &#8220;use it up&#8221;, and so will accelerate things a little.
