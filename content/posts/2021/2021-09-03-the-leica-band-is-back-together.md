<!--kg-card-begin: html-->My repaired and overhauled Leica M4 was returned to me today. It&#8217;s beautiful, and with new shutter curtains and gearing, it works flawlessly. It&#8217;s so smooth! Apparently, most of the original lubricants had dried, which was making it a little catchy. Now it&#8217;s like butter again.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

So I currently have four beautiful Leica M cameras in perfect working order. They are (from left to right in the photo)&#8230;

**Leica M4** (1966). I purchased this M4 in 2009. It&#8217;s not my first Leica (that was an M6TTL bought in 2004(?)), but I&#8217;ve had it the longest. One cool feature of this particular camera is that it has the M3/M2 style levers, which I prefer. I&#8217;m happy to have it back.

**Leica M3** (1960). The OG Leica M that started it all. I love the super-bright, high-magnification viewfinder with a 50mm or 90mm lens.

**Leica M6** (1998). Purchased in 2017, this particular M6 is one of the last 10 made, which I think is cool. It&#8217;s had the MP finder upgrade and the unneeded frame lines masked out. Since it has a meter, this is the body that gets color film when I&#8217;m in the mood for color. A great workhorse of a camera.

**Leica MP** (2021). The idea of having a brand new Leica film camera has haunted me for years. This year I was fortunate enough to find and purchase a brand new black paint MP. It&#8217;s just the most beautiful thing. My &#8220;forever&#8221; camera (assuming I never change my mind about shooting film ????.)

That&#8217;s sixty years of innovation, Leica style. It&#8217;s what happens when you get it right the first time.
