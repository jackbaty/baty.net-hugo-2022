<!--kg-card-begin: html-->I watched the following video by Ramsey Spencer yesterday and I&#8217;ve been fuming about it ever since:<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

What a load of elitist bullshit. I realize he&#8217;s just trying to make a name for himself so people &#8220;click Like and Subscribe, guys,&#8221; but grrrrrr!

Don&#8217;t listen to him. Use what makes you happy. Use what makes sense for your photography and budget. If you&#8217;re like me, using Leica cameras makes you happy. I have spent an embarrassing amount of money on Leica lenses over the years, but I also use Sigma, Canon, and Voigtlander lenses on Leica bodies and they&#8217;re all great or fun or interesting or all of the above.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

People have all sorts of reasons for using Leica cameras, and yes, the ability to use Leica lenses is one of them. Others may be attracted to the history and reputation of Leica. That&#8217;s fine, too. Some, like me, just adore using cameras that are over-engineered and manufactured to such a high degree of quality that you can _feel_ it the minute you pick them up.

I&#8217;d enjoy using my Leica M cameras even if the only lenses I could afford were made from the bottom of a Coke bottle. Don&#8217;t let some snobby, narrow-minded douche tell you what&#8217;s right or wrong for your photography.

_Yeesh, that came out a little harsh, but I&#8217;m leaving it for now because I&#8217;m still pissed._<figure class="wp-block-image size-large kg-card kg-image-card">
