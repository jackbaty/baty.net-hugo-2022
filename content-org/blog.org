AI continues to enthrall everyone. Here's DHH on AI creativity vs humans:

#+begin_quote
Why shouldn't the same be true of AI generated novels, plays, or movies? What realm of creative production does not benefit from the out-of-the-norm inferences that computers have already proven they can make within the bounds of chess and go to great effect? Is what we call human creativity all that different from a large language model anyway? A distillation of observations, inputs, mimetic tendencies, and a wetware random generator?

DHH, [[https://world.hey.com/dhh/more-creative-than-mere-humans-af8e6220][More creative than mere humans]]
#+end_quote

Fair questions. I just wish he wouldn't keep calling us "mere humans".

In the meantime, JFC stop posting every single conversation you have with ChatGPT. It's /already/ boring.

What shall we talk about today? Oh, I ordered a [[https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731283-REG/fujifilm_16782636_x_t5_mirrorless_camera_with.html][Fujifilm X-T5]] and am selling the Panasonic Lumix S5. I don't enjoy using the S5 so it, and lenses, are going. I'm trading the S5 body for 3 Fuji lenses: 23mm f2, 35mm f1.4, and 56mm f1.2. This means I'll also need a macro lens if I want to scan 120 or 4x5 film negatives. I can live with that. I'm looking forward to having a digital camera with real dials for the important things again.

For some reason, Hugo's built-in RSS template only includes post summaries, which feels like a selfish default. I've copied and tweaked the default to use full content. Also, it was including all kinds of pages so I've restricted it to entries of type "posts" and "journal" and limited the whole thing to 20 items.

I'm happy overall with this Hugo blog and theme, which means I'll probably switch to WordPress or something soon. *UPDATE* Instead of replacing baty.net, I moved [[https://copingmechanism.com][Copingmechanism.com]] from Ghost to WordPress with a fresh new theme. Hopefully, I got that out of my system.

Every week I do a water change in my aquarium. I put a record on while I drain 5 of the 30 gallons in the tank. I vacuum the rocks while siphoning. I change the filter. Then I pump in 5 gallons of fresh, homemade saltwater. It annoys the hell out of the fish and briefly upsets the corals, but it feels good and keeps the various chemical parameters in check. I love this new reef tank hobby.

People on every "side" have seemingly adopted their own narratives about how Twitter is doing. It's either finally a place for "Free Speech" or a hellscape riddled with nazis. It's also doomed to technical collapse any second because people were fired. Musk is a genius with a grand plan or he has no idea what he's doing and is just a rich asshole winging it while trolling the whole world. My take? Only time will tell.

Am I really so creatively barren that I can't even think of interesting AI prompts?

"Intellectual Honesty" is too often a cover for cruelty.

I no longer feel comfortable using Ghost for the copingmechanism.com blog. The idea of "building an audience" or "monetizing my content" is repulsive to me, and that's all Ghost is about now. On the other hand, I'd rather not use WordPress because it's just so big and, for lack of a better word, clunky.


This is neat: Arc Browser just added "Developer Mode" when browsing websites on localhost. It adds an indicator in the sidebar and exposes a full URL bar and tools for clearing cookies/caches. I'll use this often.

I may have gotten too fancy with `<blockquote>` handling. I was automatically tweaking the display of the last paragraph, assuming it's always a citation, but it's /not/ always a citation. Let's see if I can fix it:

#+begin_quote
This is a quote that has only a single paragraph. It should not be aligned right or in a smaller font.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
And this one *does* have a citation as the last paragraph, so it should be right-aligned, smaller, with a dashed prefix.

👋 Hello, and welcome to December!

I had [[/2022/my-first-real-ai-moment][my first real AI moment]] this morning.

It's nice to see [[https://kottke.org/22/11/hi-hello-im-back-at-it][Kottke is back]].

Speaking of wild new software capabilities, [[https://rewind.ai][Rewind.ai]] just enabled live Zoom transcriptions:

#+begin_quote
Now you can search across any words spoken during Zoom meetings. It also works in realtime: if you get
called on and want to reference what was just being said, just rewind to see the transcript.
#+end_quote

There are times I grow weary of using Emacs (and /any/ plain text) and start looking at prettier, pointy-clickier alternatives. This is dumb, because Emacs and Org-mode are so completely flexible and powerful that everything else pales in comparison. The novelty soon wears off and I'm back home in Emacs.

I'm giving up on scanning film with a digital camera. That process is even more annoying than using a clunky flatbed and the awful SilverFast. Last thing I want is to dick around with RAW files from my film negatives or be forced to use Lightroom because Negative Lab Pro is the only decent option for conversion. Not dealing with all that is half the reason for shooting film in the first place. Trading my Lumix S5 for a V850.

I've been futzing around in Emacs all day. It's been both wonderful and frustrating, but I think I'm getting somewhere. Most of the day was around [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]], Email, and my capture process.

Trying Prot's [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/standard-themes][Standard Themes for GNU Emacs]] because it looks like default Emacs but as an actual theme. Here's the introduction:

#+begin_quote
The standard-themes are a pair of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs. They emulate the out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute a theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency, customizability, and extensibility.

I took a couple of days away from social media and it was refreshing, but I'm heading back in to [[https://fosstodon.org/@jackbaty][Mastodon]] today. I miss people. Some of them anyway. Maybe they've stopped talking about Twitter and telling other people how to use social media? We'll see.

This morning I had either a kind of epiphany or simply a crazy thought, and that is that maybe what I need is not digital, but rather an easier/faster film camera.

Should I feel more guilty for not promoting or helping with everyone's Twitter->Mastodon migration? I love the idea of a "fediverse" and hope Mastodon is successful, but I don't feel a desire or obligation to be part of the machinery making it happen. I just want to be a participant, if that's OK.

Good morning. I can tell it's going to be an Emacs kind of day. I just wish it weren't a why-the-hell-doesn't-org-download-work-right kind of day. I'm going to gut everything Doom Emacs does to org-download and configure it myself. I think I tried and failed at this before but here goes.

Four 4x5 sheets of HP5 are washing and I just loaded a roll of 120 on the reel. I've no idea if anything good will come of it but at least I /made/ something today. For a change.

I'm seriously considering an extended break from /all/ social media.
I'm exhausted from watching everyone telling everyone else how to be or who they're allowed to like or what they're doing wrong. Either that, or they scroll around looking for something to point and yell, "That's bad!" I don't need it. I'll miss a lot of cool people saying smart things and FOMO is powerful, but my mental health needs the respite. In the meantime, I'll be posting here on the blog and reading my RSS feed like a grown up.

The thing about sitting at a computer is that it never feels like I'm not /doing something/. On the other hand, after stepping away and just standing/sitting somewhere, after 30 seconds I feel like I'm /not/ doing something and feel itchy. It's not healthy to feel that way.

I like using film because everything else quickly becomes a contest about technical perfection and I find that boring.

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by social media right now. It feels crowded, somehow. I guess that's the whole point, but it's too much. I [[/2022/calm-technology/][wrote a short post about it]].

A lot of people are linking to [[https://andschwa.com/posts/emacs-on-an-ipad/][Emacs on an iPad]]. There's no way I'm doing all that.

If I love plain text so much then why do I turn frickin' everything into PDFs?

Oh my, look at all these blogs! https://ooh.directory/

I struggle with organizing my notes because sometimes projects are a bunch of files with some notes to back them up but other times they are a bunch of notes with supporting files. The way I think of each affects how I want to organize it.

Do you ever tire of things breaking for no obvious reason and then having to debug them for hours? I do. It's always something. Yesterday Emacs gave me grief for a couple hours. Then about half of the sounds on my phone stopped working. Then I couldn't mount my Time Machine drive. Then I couldn't move emails using Mu4e. Then then then. I think I'll go back to a pencil and paper.

I'm feeling rather pointy-clicky today. I want to just lean back, grab the mouse, move things around and maybe type a few words while I'm at it.

Can you imagine how good I'd be at the old things if I would stop constantly moving to the new things?

Social media has become exhausting for me. Even Mastodon is annoying now that everyone feels the need to tell everyone else how they're supposed to /be/ on the platform. It's all either that or bitching or snickering. I doubt I'll do anything about it, though.

Come to think of it, what I want isn't so much "social" media but rather a place where I can talk about myself in public 😆. And I already have several of those places. They're called "blogs".

I have mixed feelings about all the gatekeeping going on by Mastodon “old-timers”. I understand that what they want is to maintain the culture that they’ve worked so hard to cultivate, however, culture is determined by the people in the community. There are a lot more (new) people now, so things are going to change, whether you wish them to or not.

I'm in that mood again where I want to use as few apps as possible to run things around here. One trigger for this is that I really love the Arc Browser. Arc makes me want to use more web apps. For example, I've been running Slack in a browser tab rather than using the Mac app. Also, I'm using Fastmail's web UI instead of Apple Mail. I even flirted with Tana for a minute.

When I grow frustrated with indecision around my note-taking process, I often seek refuge in paper notebooks. That's not the answer either, so the carousel continues to spin.

I keep trying to enjoy using Obsidian, but I still don't like using Obsidian. I wish I understood why. I think it's simply that it doesn't feel comfortable. I don't love the way it looks or behaves. I think the availability of so many plugins is as much a hindrance to me as it is a benefit. The community is vast and great, but is also generic and focused on making the software do too much, in my opinion. This leads to eternal yak shaving, which is the opposite of what my brain needs in a note-taking tool.

Well, here we go again, I guess. I don't know if I can take any more of that asshole.

I've been a fan and proponent of NASA since I was a kid. I thought of them as miracle workers. Today, I'm happy that Artemis didn't explode on the launchpad. I guess I've learned to temper my expectations as I get older.

I'm not sure why I'm posting another journal entry here, since I prefer the way [[https://baty.blog][baty.blog]] handles it.

It's possible that I will remove the journal section from the home page and navigation here and just stick with Tinderbox at baty.blog for the journals, but that's still maintaining two blogs and I have a somewhat love/hate set of feelings around that.

Good morning. It's 4:45 am and I'm posting to three different blogs already

Mondays are for thinking about how I'm going to improve the situation for myself, family, and friends. Today feels different. Today feels like it could be the Monday before Democracy begins its move to hospice.

Each morning, I wake up, walk the dog, sit down at the computer, and decide to tear down everything I'd done the day before.

Mastodon is currently a flurry of posts either offering advice to new users or chiding those offering that advice.

Was reading a forum thread about storing film negatives and a surprising number of people separated them by film size or camera. To me, that's not a good sign.

I don't think my digital note-taking tools are doing the best job of helping me be smarter/more creative/whatever.

Today: Tana is more useful long term than Obsidian because it's an outliner that can easily summarize and display things over time. Obsidian is better in the very long term because it's local Markdown files.

I thought Tana was a Roam/Airtable/Notion thing but the more I use it, the more it feels like Tinderbox. I was reminded of this when I learned that "Supertags" can use inheritance.

Yesterday I asked, "[[https://baty.net/2022/where-would-you-like-to-see-daily-notes/][Where would you like to see daily notes?]]". I received more replies than expected (thanks!) and they overwhelmingly preferred that I keep the daily notes here at baty.net and provide access via RSS. Well OK then! Note that journal posts aren't included in the main RSS feed, but rather at [[https://baty.net/journal/index.xml][/journal/index.xml]]. That way you can easily opt-out if you'd prefer only seeing the "real" posts. Or maybe I'll find a way to delay the inclusion of journals into the main RSS feed until later in the day. Still noodlin' on it. I mean, one post per day shouldn't be too noisy, right?

Shoehorning everything into Emacs in order to avoid "context switching" (as if that actually makes one more productive) is really just self-deceptive rationalization. I should know, I do it all the time.

Related: I'm not sure I can live with putting everything into Tana app. As clever as it is, it's "out there" and will probably be replaced in a year or two by something newer and shinier. It's not as pretty, and not as easy, but I'm better off staying in Emacs. Maybe one day, when I need to collaborate with others, using Tana will be feasible.

90% of the chatter around Tools For Thought is thinly-veiled rationalization for just fucking around with software.

I assume that most of the people fawning over Tana are not familiar with Tinderbox, TiddlyWiki, or Org-mode.

I let rudimentarylathe.wiki expire and regretted it so thought I'd buy it again but it seems that someone else beat me to it.

D'ya ever feel like when you put things in a wiki that you're building something--a tool--for the future, but when you put it on a blog instead it just gets swept way into archives and likely forgotten?

I got my invitation to [[https://tana.inc/][Tana]] yesterday. At first blush it feels like a combination of Roam and Tinderbox and TiddlyWiki. Not sure yet if it's too Notion-like. I dislike Notion so that would be bad. I'm going to give it a spin for a while and see. One thing for sure, like every other app, I am always thinking that I already have almost everything Tana offers right in Emacs.

Ever since smartphones got "good enough," they've created tension in my life. All too often, they've been "the camera I've had with me." And that's been to the detriment of my photography, because photographs happen to you when you're out and about with a camera, and, contrary to the common truism, the best camera is not the one you have with you. In fact, it's a very common mistake, and occasionally a tragedy, to have nothing but the wrong camera with you. What you really need to have with you is the right camera, the camera the occasional good pictures should have been taken with.

I'm writing in my journal this morning using Emacs and Org-journal. I really like the combination, but it's super nerdy and only works on my Mac. What I'd prefer is to use Day One so that all my image entries and longer notes could live in the same place and I could type them on any device. When I export a PDF every month it would be complete and once a year I could print a nice book with a selection of entries. So why don't I do this? Because I prefer typing in Emacs and Org-mode and I prefer the way exports from Emacs look. If I could get over that, things would get easier.

An emerging note taking utility is Denote; in this document I want to explore my usage of Org-Roam; what I’ve come to expect (e.g. consider a “must have”) and what I’ve come to appreciate (e.g. consider a “nice to have”). I then want to look at how to achieve that in Denote.

I'll be keeping an eye on Jeremy's progress, as I waffle between Org-roam and [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]] myself. After all, I just put [[/2022/everything-is-in-org/][everything in Org-roam]] so let's not get too comfortable, eh? One of the things that attracts me to Denote is that it's simple, considered, and doesn't try to be everything to everyone. Each member of the Org-roam community, on the other hand, seems obsessed with bending it to their specific will. It's a recipe for complexity.

Now that Roam and Roam-alikes are The Thing, maybe the web can get backlinks as originally planned.

The {{{mark(Paper vs Digital debate)}}} continues apace. One nice thing about notes on paper is that I’m not tempted, nor do I feel obligated, to share them. On the other hand, what if I do want to share them?

{{{img(scrintal.png, Scrintal home page)}}}

Scrintal opened up their waitlist for anyone willing to pay an introductory annual subscription fee, so I jumped on it. Then after 10 minutes I realized {{{mark(I have no need for yet another note-taking app)}}} so I wrote them asking for a refund. It looks like a fine tool, but I need to pass.

I should probably lead with this, but after a month of testing this blog at [[https://blot.im][Blot.im]] I am bringing it {{{mark(back home to Hugo on my VPS)}}}. Maybe I'll write up some details later.

...these two attributes combined to create something very special in PHP: support for the “hackish state”, an environment optimal for casual tinkering with server-side scripting — without having to bring out a whole framework and take the time to set it up. If you had an idea for some kind of dynamic, server-side behaviour, you could probably have it prototyped in PHP in 15 minutes. It might be crude, but it would be real.

I'm willing to bet that if I took up PHP again and just ran with a bunch inline MySQL queries and CSS and a lot of copy and paste, I could outrun all y'all.

I fired up my old [[https://jackbaty.blot.im][Blot blog]] yesterday for no particular reason. It was fun to play with [[https://blot.im][Blot.im]] again. I got so excited that for a minute I considered moving this blog over to Blot. I like the simplicity of Blot vs Hugo. It's just markdown files in a Dropbox folder. There's no deployment or rendering or dependencies and I find that attractive. I just don't know if I have the energy to do a migration like that right now.

I switched back to the HHKB this morning because I prefer it by a wide margin to any other keyboard I've tried.

After more than a year with the [[https://baty.net/2021/pilot-custom-823-fountain-pen/][Pilot Custom 823]] fountain pen, I can say that I have no need for other pens. The only time I choose a different pen is when I'm bored and feel like using something different. It lasts a day or so and I'm back to using the Pilot. It's possible that I'll never buy another fountain pen.

I've also switched back to a ruled notebook. Dot grid pages feel like the worst of both worlds.

Alright, I'm no longer distinguishing between journal and blog posts on the home page here. The latest 10 entries will show up, regardless of type. I should probably force today's journal page to the top, but until that becomes a problem in real life I'm going to leave it alone.

It's Monday morning at 5:10 am and I am supposed to start a "Weekly Review" soon but I don't feel like it. I don't feel like much of anything, actually.

I finished all 5 seasons of "Breaking Bad" last night. It may be Quality Television™, but it was also nothing but horrible people doing horrible things and I'm a lesser person for having watched it.

Raw speed is nowhere near the top of my list of things to consider when buying a keyboard.

I'm tempted to cancel every subscription I can reasonably live without.

After reading [[https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-obsessive-pleasures-of-mechanical-keyboard-tinkerers][The obsessive pleasures of modern keyboard tinkerers]] (h/t [[https://twelvety.blot.im/daily/2022/2022-08-28][Phil]]), I of course wanted a new keyboard. Instead of shopping for one, I dug the [[https://www.realforcekeyboards.com/][RealForce R2]] out of the closet. It's a fine keyboard, and uses my favorite Topre switches, but it's just [[https://archive.baty.net/2020/can-realforce-replace-hhkb/][not the same as my beloved HHKB]].

Using a nice pen on good paper makes writing by hand a pleasure, but if I'm being honest I prefer typing most of the time. Especially when using a delightful keyboard or typewriter.

I used the Leica M3 for a while this weekend and it's amazing how good it can feel not chasing lights and numbers around in the viewfinder. No metering, focusing reticles, etc. It's more work and one must pay more attention, but maybe that's why it's so nice. It almost makes me want to replace my MP with the meterless M-A. Almost.

OMG please stop saying "This is the way" every time you agree with something.

I spent way too much time yesterday trying to regain control over the Sonos Playbar's sound using my LG TV and Apple TV remotes. Lots of swearing and doing the same things over and over hoping they work this time. Eventually, I got it working, sort of. I'm still pissed.

Wow, I just accidentally long-pressed on a photo in Apple Photos and it magically masked and cut the subject (a person) and I was able to copy just the person into another app. Is this new? It's a bit sloppy in the masking, but still kind of magic.

It is unlikely, though not impossible, that someone sickened by China’s campaign against the Uyghurs is indifferent to the plight of migrants or supportive of retaining the detention center at Guantánamo. But it is undeniably true that how somebody feels or posts online is not going to do anything to help any of these people, and even truer that scolding someone about his selective outrage will not.
...

But the other great crime of whataboutism is that it solidifies the online sense that the appearance of paying attention is paramount—not actually paying attention...Most forms of paying attention involve reading and listening, not talking. Caring about something and staying informed is not synonymous with public speech about it.

When someone suggests that doing everything in Emacs helps make them more efficient because there's less "context switching" I think about two things: First, is context switching really that expensive? And second, it took you 5 years to get Emacs to a point where you're productive with it, and you ain't never going to make up that time.

Face it, though, I'm most comfortable in Emacs, even though I'd often rather be somewhere prettier and more pointy-clicky.

Did you know that you can toggle the display of hidden (dot) files in macOS Finder by hitting =Command-Shift-.= ? I didn't know that.

I get up each morning and sit down in front of Emacs and wonder if I'll still be there at the end of the day. Or will I have switched to some other tool. And back again.

12 hours later: I dove back into TiddlyWiki and TheBrain, with a short sidetrack into Curio, but yes, I'm back in Emacs this evening. As usual.

I love the way [[https://thebrowser.company/][Arc]] handles links from other apps by opening a small, dedicated window but with the option to move it into the main window.

I received several nice responses to [[https://rudimentarylathe.org/2022/the-lathe-saturday-august-20-2022/][the recent newsletter]] and that makes me feel pretty good.

I had to go back to Doom Emacs and stop using my own configuration. There's just too much missing from mine that Doom does out of the box. Plus, I've already contaminated my muscle memory with Doom's use of Space as leader key. I kind of hate myself for this, but here we are.

I get reminders every Monday from at least 3 apps telling me to "Do a Weekly Review" but I still never do a weekly review.

Twitter is still useful and I keep it usable by only following people who don't spend all day looking for things to be mad at and by never ever clicking on a trending topic. Oh, and disabling all retweets.

I never feel quite in control of the Lumix S5. Did I reset the exposure compensation? Did I return it to Auto-ISO? On the other hand, one glance at the M3 and I know everything I need to. And I can change them by feel, without menus or anything. It's calming. The Lumix kind of stresses me out.

I'd be more interested in spending time on the [[https://micro.blog][Micro.blog]] timeline if they'd implement (private) likes. As it stands, my timeline consists almost entirely of things like "@person Nice! 👏" because there's no other way to acknowledge something.

I'm typing this in Emacs as an Org-mode file and I guess that means Emacs and I have made up after our little tiff yesterday.

I'm also running an Emacs config based on [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs][Crafted Emacs]], which is pretty minimal and easy to get one's head around. It also means I'm continually frustrated by things not being as polished and custom as in Doom. I'm taking solace in the fact that I'm learning /real/ Emacs this way.

This could be a good idea: [[https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/well-known-links-resource/][A Well-known Links Resource]]. Basically, they suggest indexing your site's outbound links and making them available.

I'm trying to train my fingers to use pinky-and-middle-finger for =C-x= and pinky-and-index-finger for =C-c=. It's not going well, yet.

I wonder how long I'll have the energy and time to do this every day. Oh, I don't know, it's been like 20 years already, so.

We sure spend a lot of time on fancy tooling and frameworks for what boils down to the same simple CRUD apps we've been building for 30 years.

I have seven years of entries in my daybook.org file. I suppose that means it works for me, but it could also just be inertia.

It's just that sometimes I tire of staring at (mostly) monospaced text in Emacs. Sometimes I don't find it fun to have to figure out why some minor behavior isn't working the same as it was last week. Taking notes shouldn't be a technical challenge. I don't always want to =M-x= my way through life. And yet, nothing else comes close.

Some days I want to live entirely within Emacs. Other days I'd be fine doing everything in a browser. These two modes don't get along.

I signed up for a year of [[https://hey.com][Hey.com]] again. I can't explain why. I think maybe I'm exhausted from spending so much energy and time recently getting [[https://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] configured. It's been a blast, but sometimes I just want something pretty and easy.

I don't feel much like writing full-on blog posts. I still feel like typing words and publishing them, but just not in a cohesive, separate-blog-post way. I am much more into stream-of-thought posts like I'm doing here in the journal posts. It makes me think that the structure here is backwards. Maybe I should show full posts of several daily entries with a simple list of links to recent blog posts. Hmmm.

I was looking for something that I would have written while using org-roam so I re-enabled org-roam in my config and went looking. I was sidetracked immediately because the org-roam results buffer was showing links in their raw form and it was distracting. After an hour of digging, testing other versions, etc, I found [[https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/org-roam-backlinks-appearing-with-id/2716/5?u=jbaty][this comment]] which pointed to a fix (e.g. =(setq org-fold-core-style “overlays”)=, added in org 9.6).

I find that many of my favourite lyrics are those that I do not fully understand. They seem to exist in a world of their own – in a place of potentiality, adjacent to meaning. The words feel authentic or true, but remain mysterious, as if a greater truth lies just beyond our understanding. I see this, not just within a song, but within life itself, where awe and wonder live in the tension between what we understand and what we do not understand.

I went back to reprocess a Canon RAW file from 2014. I opened the file in Capture One and hit "Auto" and it looked beautiful, rich, and correct. I did the same in Lightroom Classic and it looked boring and pale. I know that I can always get nearly the same output in both apps if I work hard enough, but getting results I like immediately out of C1 is a feature hard to ignore.

I've replaced Cusdis comments here with a simple email link. Emails are forever and it removes the performative nature of public comments.

They: "So, tell me about your photographic work." \\
Me: "Oh, it's mostly just test images after getting new camera gear."

So, I'm basically now using Capture One for digital photos and Lightroom Classic/Photoshop for film. Sigh.

I have got to find a way to get more sleep. According to Autosleep, I've been averaging around five and a half hours. I need seven.

There's been nothing much happening over at [[https://wiki.baty.net][the wiki]]. I don't know what to do about that. My daily notes are here on baty.net and the rest of my notes have been in Denote/Org mode. Writing topic notes publicly was perhaps too performative, but it was also motivating for me. I'm sure I took better notes in public. Still mulling this over.

I suppose I should write an actual blog post about moving my email from Mu4e to Notmuch, but I don't feel like it. I mean, the gist of it would be simply "Hey, I moved my email from Mu4e to Notmuch!" with a few unhelpful paragraphs about why. Can't I just mention it here and move on?

Yesterday I was all fired up about my new email setup. I was nerding out with Emacs and having a ball. Today, it all feels like too much work and I almost miss my Hey.com account.

There's a nice-looking resume template in LaTeX I wanted to try, but the example I found involved pulling down a Docker image first and jesus christ how did we get here.

Feeling the Poloaroid today. Part of me wants to order a shitload of Polaroid film, as expensive and unpredictable as it is, and just shoot.

A great thing about shooting Polaroid film is that once you've pressed the button, you're done with that photo. There's nothing left to do but grab a pen and write a caption on it, and even that's optional.

Amazon bought Roomba. I wonder if this means that I'll be able to buy a Roomba for $69 in exchange for sending Amazon a detailed map of my house.

I've spent the morning learning how to use [[https://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] in Emacs. It's quite different from Mu4e, but uses many of the same parts (mbsync, xapian, smtpmail, etc.). Notmuch relies almost entirely on tagging and doesn't touch my emails. This is nice because I don't fear sync issue, but is troublesome because the tags aren't reflected on the server. Still putzing with it.

A big problem I had was where to put my stuff. I tried different databases, folder structures, private websites, cloud drives, and desktop search tools. The key, finally, was to turn nearly everything in my life into emails. All my calendar entries, essay drafts, tweets—I wrote programs that turned them into gigs and gigs of emails. Emails are horrible, messy, swollen, decrepit forms of data, but they are understood by everything everywhere. You can lard them with attachments. You can tag them. You can add any amount of metadata to them and synchronize them with servers. They suck, but they work. No higher praise.

Rather than using Org-mode and ox-hugo to generate today's journal, I used Hugo's built-in command, so... =hugo new /2022/2022-07-29-Friday/index.md= ...and here we are. I don't know whether I'll continue to do this, but I do like that there's one fewer layer between what I'm typing and what shows up on the blog. I love writing Org-mode files using Emacs, but sometimes it's fun to use whichever Markdown editor I'm in the mood for. This morning, that editor is [[https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/][BBEdit]].

Maybe I can replace Algolia for search here soon: [[https://pagefind.app/][Pagefind]] looks like just the ticket. (via [[https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/07/pagefind-quite-find-site-search/][Pagefind is quite a find for site search | BryceWray.com]]). **::One hour later::** I've implemented Pagefind here. It's on the new [[/searc/][Search page]].

I'm becoming serious about selling the M10-R. I've so far refused a few offers because they were too low. I am more likely to negotiate, now.

I'm going to the lakeshore today and decided to take only the Olympus Stylus Epic loaded with TMAX 100. It's been acting flakey lately so this will be a good test.

I hadn't planned on doing much customization to the new theme here, but I really wanted to keep my daily journal posts, so here we are. I had to add a "journal" post type and supporting templates so that the most recent entry is displayed on the home page and the entire entry is shown rather than just the summary. Hugo templates are tricky, but I'm getting the hang of them.

I'm starting to enjoy having the Lumix S5 around. Zoom, macro, and auto-focus are handy.

After hearing rumors that Meta is going to raise the price of the Quest 2 by $100 in August, I ordered one. I'll give my dad my original Quest. Maybe we'll fish or play golf together.

I may try including a "featured image" for these journal posts, just to help make things prettier. Not sure I'll be able to keep it up every day, but let's try. Today's featured image is a macro of a new coral I added to the aquarium yesterday.

I wanted to test scanning large format negatives with the S5. Rather than digging out an old negative, I shot a few new ones. They are self-portraits, of course. [[https://baty.net/2022/a-couple-4x5-self-portraits/][A couple 4x5 self-portraits | Jack Baty]]

I almost forgot I switched back to Hugo yesterday. Hi! 👋.

Sure, iPhones are capable of taking very nice photographs. This doesn't mean I want to use one myself.

For just a moment I was entertaining the idea of selling a Leica lens, the Summilux-M 35mm ASPH (FLE), to fund something else. Then I remembered my rule: "Never sell a Leica lens" because I've regretted doing so, several times. If I become desparate, fine, but otherwise, I'm keeping it.

Good morning. I just returned from my walk with Alice through quite the thunderstorm. Kind of exhilarating, but we’re soaked.

I’m sleepy, and it’s probably because I average less than six hours of sleep. Last night brought me four hours and fourteen minutes. I try going to bed early because Alice wakes up at around 4:00 am, but it feels silly to get in bed at 8:00 pm. Besides, I’m not done yet at 8:00, so it’s usually closer to 10:00. I wonder if this could explain my recent moroseness.

Using [[https://textexpander.com][TextExpander]] is starting to make me feel dirty for some reason. Maybe it's because their goals don't seem aligned with mine (see "Teams"). Also, while not inherently a bad thing, they recently took a bunch of investment money and that can make companies do things I don't approve of.

You may notice that I'm back in Hugo for the blog. There are times when convenience (ie WordPress) wins. But, I dislike /using/ WordPress and when that begins to wear on me, I crawl back to Hugo and Emacs with my tail between my legs. The following screenshot shows the way I prefer to work, so I'm back.

{{{img(/img/2022/20220724--emacs-hugo.png, Mmmm\, this is the way)}}}

I'm beginning to believe that keeping notes in tiny, single-thought "Zettelkastans" is not for me. When there are hundreds or thousands of small, separate notes, it requires software to tie things together. I'm inclined to use longer "topic journal" files for specific topics. And rather than linking to them in a "daily note", I add log entries to the bottom of the files themselves. No backlinks required.

I used to love using "U-Point Technology" years ago in the old Nikon Capture NX app and it's fun to see how far it's come. But it's not U-Point or "Smart Lighting" that draws me to it. It's the lens profiles and the completely amazing DeepPRIME noise reduction. It's like having at least two additional stops available.

Instead, Joe Pera is like stepping out on a break from work, taking a deep breath, and having a stranger say to you, “Nice out, isn’t it?” You register this as an intrusion, an annoying solicitation for conversation, before noticing that it is, indeed, nice out.

I've given up on configuring my Emacs setup using [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs][Rational Emacs]] and gone back to [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom]]. As much as building my own config interests me, I'll never in a million years get close to the level of refinement that Doom offers. I'm better off just riding along with a "bloated" framework and focusing on /using/ Emacs instead of playing with it.

No one gets to decide whether {{{mark(my subjects are "worthy")}}} of the cameras I use to photograph them.

Let's face it, I prefer {{{mark(writing in Org-mode)}}}.

Thing is, I structure my system around {{{mark(tools that I'm interested in at the time)}}}. Since I'm always trying different tools, my systems change regularly and cannot be trusted 😀.

I'm thinking about {{{mark(how far in I should go with)}}} [[https://www.thebrain.com][TheBrain]]. I'm convinced that, long-term, TheBrain is a good, possibly the /best/, solution for extended memory and notes. I can jump into any project, topic, or event and immediately see everything related to that "thought". And this isn't driven only via random linking. TheBrain's "Plex" is created entirely from deliberate linking. It's not a cool-but-nearly-useless explosion of linked notes (see Obsidian). But, it's an app and not a nice, safe, comfortable folder full of plain text files.

Writing here feels like I'm {{{mark(standing on my porch quietly handing out pamphlets)}}}. This is better than social media which is more like me walking down the street yelling at everyone.

Someone said "He's godless" in a conversation and I felt I had to remind them that {{{mark(everyone is godless)}}}. Some just pretend otherwise.

"Backlinks"? More like "DistractionLinks" amirite?

One thing about [[https://www.thebrain.com][TheBrain]] is that its "knowledge graph" visualization isn’t just a clever side effect of linking (see [[https://obsidian.md][Obsidian]]). It's core to the way the app works.

I don't feel like being here today. {{{mark(The world depresses me)}}}. The people in it depress me. I'm a middle aged white CIS male, which means I have little to worry about, personally, from our new reality. I'm privileged. I can't even imagine what the world must feel like for anyone /not/ like me. My heart breaks as I watch everything become darker for so many people.

I donate. I vote. I advocate with real people (meaning /not/ on social media). At some point I'll protest and it's looking more and more likely that, eventually, {{{mark(I'll fight)}}}.

In the meantime, writing random notes here about nothing important is therapy for me. You may think that I should {{{mark(shut up about trivial things)}}} in the aftermath of every horrific event in the world, but I disagree. Again, therapy. This for me not for you.

[[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]] is really coming along nicely.

I'm once again obsessed with [[https://www.thebrain.com][TheBrain]] and have moved most of my note-taking there. It really does offer a great balance between note-taking and linking and search and scale. The friction of where to put/link things is just high enough that I don't fall into the collect-everything trap. Makes it more useful over time.

I hate that using a Leica MP makes me feel {{{mark(smugly superior)}}} to your run-of-the-mill hipster with an M6. Especially since most of them are probably making better photos than I am.

When I stop to think about it, the thought is a little scary. As someone who enjoys exploring productivity and meta-research tooling, I do pause to think that I'm "stuck" using org-mode and Emacs from time to time. But I don't really see any other way:

I have a decision to make regarding [[https://www.orgroam.com][Org-roam]] vs [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]]. Both, of course, work well as note-taking tools. The decision is between all-the-features-I-could-ever-need and a simple folder full of text files, with no dependencies. I'm very much enamored by the second option, therefore Denote is the hot option right now. But, I'd miss the fancy back-linking and tooling of Org-roam. Still noodlin'

When using variable-pitched fonts in Emacs, the [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][Modus themes]] are the only themes that handle the various options correctly. For example, with =:PROPERTIES:= drawers, the start and end labels should be monospaced. Modus are the only themes I've found that do this out of the box. It's a small thing, but demonstrates the care that has gone into the themes.

I sometimes consider {{{mark(trading the M10-R for a (regular) Q2)}}}. I miss the convenience of auto-focus and weather sealing and simplicity offered by the Q2. I almost never change lenses on the M10-R, but I can never get over the fact that with a Q2 I /can't/ change lenses. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the 28mm focal length.

I spent more time yesterday testing the [[https://www.thebrain.com/products/thebrain/thebrain13][new (alpha) version of TheBrain]]. Changes to the notes editor are quite nice. A little too WYSIWYG for my taste, but I think most people will like it. The biggest problem is that TheBrain is not Emacs. I find TheBrain to be wildly useful for making and finding connections. Its search is fast and there's really no fear of outgrowing it. But yeah, I want to use Emacs for notes. I could attach org files to "thoughts" and put my notes in those instead, but that seems like swimming upstream, especially with v13's improved Markdown editor. Still tinkering with it, though.

There is not enough energy in my life to spend it on {{{mark(finding things to bitch about)}}}.

I have no knowledge of any specifics, no insider information of any sort (I'm an outsider for sure where Leica is concerned): but I think the "gestalt," as they say, of the Leica M10 was guided by a single person, a single vision. And from the evidence, it seems like that person must be a photographer. Regardless of who engineered it. That's just what it feels like.

One difference between a tool like {{{mark(Logseq and Org-roam)}}} is that with Logseq, connections just appear and are easy to spot. It makes serendipitous discovery more likely. With Org-roam it feels like I need to go /looking/ for connections. If I need to go looking, the tool is less useful.

Still waffling on {{{mark(Hugo vs Ghost)}}}. I spent so much time over the weekend setting up Ghost and migrating content. I like how it looks and I like the editor. I like just dragging images to make galleries or featured images. I like that switching templates is much easier. I like that I get a built-in newsletter engine for free. I like that I can just edit a post in place right in the browser rather than Emacs->Org->Hugo->sync. But, it's not plain text. I can't write in Org-mode/Emacs. I don't understand Ghost templates. Hosting requirements are higher. On top of all that, I feel like a "static website" person, not a "use a CMS" person. I know that's silly, but I can't ignore it.

*UPDATE:* We're back on Hugo for baty.net. I had fun tinkering with Ghost but it just doesn't /feel/ right. (This is me [[https://baty.net/2022/use-what-you-have/][using what I have]])

I'm hungry.

Contemplating the {{{mark(pros and cons of using ox-hugo)}}} for posting here. [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] is awesome, but it's yet another layer of abstraction between what I'm typing and what ends up here. I mean, I get to use Org mode for writing, which is great, but Markdown is pretty good for just writing, too. Creating the necessary files/folders for new posts is a no-brainer in ox-hugo, once things are configured. But, how long would it take me to wire up the equivalent with a bit o' lisp and a snippet or two? With ox-hugo, everything is in one big Org file. I love the idea of this, but I don't know how /useful/ it is. Then again, it /works/!. Still noodlin'. Trying to remember to Use What You Have.

I've been using the {{{mark(stacking feature on my macOS desktop)}}} for a couple of weeks and, surprisingly, I don't hate it. I thought I'd hate it, but it's kind of nice having things organized for me. It's not the way /I'd/ normally organize things, but once I just let it do its thing, I stopped worrying about it.'

Moved my theme's git repo to Sourcehut, too. https://git.sr.ht/~jbaty/codeit-theme. It's part of the [[https://sr.ht/~jbaty/baty.net/][baty.net project.]] I have to admit, [[https://sourcehut.org][Sourcehut]] is growing on me.

I'm inclined to over-think my note taking process, but [[https://sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/][this is next level]].

As soon as I load up an article about social networks or productivity or what have you, I search for things like "walled garden" and "dopamine" and if I find any occurrences, I don't feel like I need to bother reading the article because it's almost certainly the same as all the others.

I've been a [[https://put.io][put.io]] user for 10 years, they tell me. They also, as a thank you, sent me a free year of the 1TB plan. That was nice of them.

I spent six hours this morning working on a {{{mark(custom Emacs config)}}}. From scratch. I copied and pasted some of my stuff from my Doom config, but mostly I opted for the defaults. It was horrible. Nothing works nearly as nicely as the Doom default setup. I mean, not even close. I'm going to continue picking at it, but I think I'm done trying to make it a daily driver.

I recently considered {{{mark(bulk loading film)}}}, but decided against it. This decision was reinforced today when (re)reading Dante Stella:

#+begin_quote
It is not entirely clear what bulk-loading gets you here – an opportunity for scratched film, the chance to expose a bulk roll while getting into the loader, losing consecutive frame numbers, and ending up with a cassette that is either missing DX codes or pops apart if you drop it. One thing it does not get you is an actual cost advantage, especially after you spend an hour or two cleaning and loading the cassettes for each 100 foot bulk roll.

I'm growing weary of {{{mark(fighting with the Focomat IIc)}}}. It's such a wonderfully-built contraption that is capable of amazing enlargements, but it's behaving badly. Exposure times are in the 3-8 second range for anything but the densest negatives. What's worse, the autofocus isn't working correctly. Autofocus is kind of the whole point of this thing. I'm starting to think I should find something modern, with readily-available replacement parts. Tired of struggling with this ancient beast.

There are some great tools for bringing web content into Markdown files, but few that offer the same utility for Org-mode ([[https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown][Orgdown]]) files.

For example, I use [[https://github.com/deathau/markdownload][Markdownload extension]] all the time. It works great with nearly every site I use it on, but instead of Markdown, I'd prefer having Org syntax, so I've worked around it by creating a function[fn:2] which converts the current region from Markdown to Org.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jab/md-to-org-region (start end)
  "Convert region from markdown to org, replacing selection"
  (interactive "r")
  (shell-command-on-region start end "pandoc -f markdown -t org" t t))
#+end_src

I copy the Markdown from the Markdownload window, paste it into an Org buffer, and run the function. It's not perfect, but until someone creates an "Orgdownload" extension, it'll do. (Pretty please, will someone create an Orgdownload extension?)

I'm a latecomer to AI, but I just had my first real AI revelation moment while using [[https://chat.openai.com/chat][OpenAI's ChatGPT]].

Here's part of the thread:

Can you imagine where this leads? I didn't really /get/ it, until having the above conversation. I'd love being in high school right now. It's like being in that brief period where calculators were still rare, so having one was like cheating. AI feels like cheating, in a good way.

This feels like the first time I dragged and resized a filled shape in MacPaint on my Macintosh Plus. Or the first time I pinched-to-zoom on the original iPhone.

:END:

I've recently switched from using [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] to using [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote][Denote]] for my notes. Org-roam is powerful and cool, but I prefer the more straightforward approach of Denote.

I keep all my notes in Denote, including notes about current projects. For example, we're planning to remodel our kitchen. This is a project and so I have a Denote file named "20221130T130143--kitchen-remodel-2023__house_project.org". In this file, I keep a list of TODOs. In order to see these TODOs in my [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][Org Agenda]], I need to add the file to org-agenda-files. This can be done a few ways, but all are manual. I am forgetful, so I wanted a more automated way to keep my org-agenda-files up to date with Denote projects.

David of System Crafters created a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUkuyW6hr18][video]] about hacking Org-roam containing something like what I was looking for [[https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/5-org-roam-hacks/#build-your-org-agenda-from-org-roam-notes][in the show notes]], but for Org-roam not Denote.

I took the idea and implemented it for Denote instead. All it does is search denote-directory for files with a specific pattern and append the results to my default list of org-agenda-files. It looks like this:


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Add all Denote files tagged as "project" to org-agenda-files
(defun jab/denote-add-to-agenda-files (keyword)
  "Append list of files containing 'keyword' to org-agenda-files"
  (interactive)
  (jab/init-org-agenda-files) ;; start over
  (setq org-agenda-files (append org-agenda-files (directory-files denote-directory t keyword))))

(jab/denote-add-to-agenda-files "_project")
#+end_src

That's it. Now I can keep my project TODOs in the project Org files and view them in the Agenda. You'll notice that there's nothing in there that actually depends on Denote. It's all just basic Emacs stuff. That's one of the reasons I love Denote so much; even /I/ can riff off it. I haven't found a good way to add newly-created project files to the agenda without reloading Emacs or calling the function manually, but I'll get to that later.

I'm overwhelmed by social media right now. Visiting Twitter just makes me anxious because it's become an even bigger shit-show and all anyone can talk about is how much of a shit-show it is.

And Mastodon is almost worse, since the only topics there right now seem to be the Twitter shit-show (but everyone calls it "birdsite" for whatever stupid reason) or how Mastodon is or isn't confusing or is or isn't racist or else over-explaining what the "fediverse" means to the future of the internet.

Everyone is just so breathy and I'm exhausted by all of it.

So, instead, I've been writing journal entries on my blog, updating my wiki, and sitting at my writing desk with a pen and a notebook. It's the latter of these things that brings me a nice sort of calm. It's not really even technology but it's where I increasingly wish to spend my time.

I'm once again leaning toward writing them on the wiki, since they can be back/linked to/from my other notes about everything. It's also super simple to create posts there. And, for some reason they don't seem to disappear down-river like they do on normal blogs like this one.

On the other hand, I quite like having all the stuff I write--most of it, anyway--in one place; here at baty.net. So there's that.

For the handful of you who read my sites any kind of regularly, where would /you/ like the daily notes to go? And second, if you prefer them on the blog, should they be included in the main RSS feed? I don't like polluting feeds with my usual circular interests, but maybe they're useful to some.

I've been testing the hot new Tana app for the past week, and I'm exhausted.

First, I don't need a Zettelkasten. If you're being honest, you probably don't either. And yet, we spend hours or days learning the "proper" way to build one. Then we set up our new system, using paper or digital or both, roll up our sleeves, and waste time putting stuff into it.

The worst part isn't the putting of stuff into my PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) system. The worst part is all of the tinkering around where to put stuff and how to classify/tag/organize it.

I made the mistake of reading "How to Take Smart Notes" by Sönke Ahrens and browsing the forums and that sent me on a spiral of worrying about atomicity, what to do about "fleeting" notes, how big is a Zettel? and so on. In other words, I was more concerned with finding the proper method of managing my notes rather than focusing on what was actually in them and what they were for.

This week's tinkering with Tana hasn't helped. Tana is the next iteration of tools based on things like Roam Research, Notion, etc. I like it. It's a bit like TiddlyWiki and Tinderbox in that it allows for additional attributes to be associated with each node and makes these ontologies easy to search, link, parse, summarize, etc. It makes some complicated workflows pretty easy to implement. I think a lot of people will dig it.

The problem is that this flexibility leads to a lot of hand-wringing over the best way to utilize all this power. The Tana Slack channels are teeming with questions about workflows and structure and attributes and on and on. It makes me tired just reading about it.

I'm not sure I need a system around, for example, the best way to surface the minutiae from interstitial journaling. In fact, just using the phrase "interstitial journaling" is a dead giveaway that I've already been overthinking it. Settle down, Jack!

Anyway, I'll keep playing with Tana for fun, but I'm probably not going to continue using it for my notes. It's not something I will benefit from, especially considering the amount of effort I'll put into setting it up and getting everything "right". I'm exhausted and I think I'll go back to using paper. Or maybe Emacs.

As much as I, ehem, [[/2022/loveit/][LoveIt]], the theme's very theme-specific magic felt like trouble waiting to happen. And honestly, I was bored with it, so I went looking for something new.

#+hugo: more

I dislike modern blog themes. They all seem to think I want a giant hero image and way too much white space. Or that I'm selling something.

I knew I liked [[https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme][the Bilberry theme]] as soon as I saw it. It's very Tumblr-esque, with its small, isolated posts and its post "types" for different kinds of content.

So I ported my content over, made a few tweaks, and here we are. You'll notice the lack of a "Journal" post each day. I haven't decided whether to spend the time implementing that or if I'll just go back to using daily.baty.net.

When I was a kid I kept a small, fresh-water aquarium. It was fun, but I always knew that the really cool fish lived in salt water. Fast forward 40 years or so and I’ve finally put together a salt-water “reef” aquarium.
I’ve started small because there seems to be quite a percentage of people who bail on them within the first year or so. I want to be sure it sticks before spending tons of money and going all-in.
I went with the “beginner” BioCube 32. I set the tank up the first week of June. Added “live” rock and sand. “Aquascaping” the aquarium was fun. I think I have a configuration that looks nice and also leaves plenty of nooks and crannies for critters to hide in. I added a powerhead pump for better flow, and waited. I had to buy water!

{{{img(/img/2022/20220708-hauling-water.jpg, Hauling saltwater for the new aquarium)}}}

New tanks need to go through an initial [[https://www.thebeginnersreef.com/fish-tank-nitrogen-cycle-step-by-step-explanation/][Nitrogen cycle]] before adding any fish or corals. This can take four to six weeks. Using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_rock][live rocks]] and sand helps move it along. I impatiently tested my water for Ammonia and Nitrites every day or two, and after just two weeks it was ready.

I added my first fish, an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocellaris_clownfish][Ocellaris Clownfish]], on July 3rd. Clowns are nearly everyone’s first fish. They’re cool and easy to care for, so why not? And who doesn’t love [[https://letterboxd.com/film/finding-nemo/][Nemo]]? Mine is a “designer” Black Clown. We named him “Marcus” for no particular reason.

Here he is in my tank:

{{{img(/img/2022/20220708-clownfish.jpg,Marcus the Clownfish in his new home)}}}

Isn’t he cute! (All clowns are born male…and cute).
Since Marcus seemed to be doing well, I added another fish yesterday: A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecsenius_bicolor][Bicolor Blenny]]. We named this one “Benny”. (I know).

{{{img(/img/2022/20220708-blenny.jpg, Bi-color Blenny)}}}

I haven’t taken a photo of him yet because he’s still hiding in a hole on the rocks. I did take a snap while acclimating him. Acclimation involves slowly dripping water from the aquarium into his water from the local fish store ([[https://watercolorsaquariumgallery.com/][Water Colors Aquarium Gallery]])

{{{img(/img/2022/20220708-acclimating-benny.jpg, Acclimating Benny)}}}

I also added a couple of Astrea snails in anticipation of algae growth. I’ll need a lot more of these eventually.

#+attr_html: :width 500
[[/img/2022/20220708-astrea-snail.png]]

So far, so good. There’s a lot to learn about keeping a reef tank. Water parameters are critical, especially with coral. I can’t wait to start adding coral! There are feeding issues, cleaning, filtering, diseases, livestock problems, and on and on. It’s awesome so far. I love fish!

Sometimes I notice the Leica M10-R sitting forlornly on my desk and I’m reminded that I don’t deserve it. A camera like that should be used, and used a lot. Mine mostly sits around waiting for me to take another selfie or photo of my dog. That’s a lot of money tied up in what most people do (and often better) with their phones.

I’m a rangefinder guy at heart. I’ve shot with one almost continually since 2003. The Leica M, whether film or digital, is IMO the pinnacle of camera design and construction. But…I often just want to have a camera with me for simple grab shots. You know, the one-handed snapshot of a friend at dinner. Or a macro of my dog’s toes. The M is not the camera for those. Not in my hands, anyway. So I long for auto-focus, and EVF, maybe even IBIS.

I thought the answer to this was to replace the M10-R with a Q2. I’ve had several Qs and they are fantastic, so I listed the M10-R and waited. I got a couple of the usual lowball offers. A few people sent questions. Then, one gentlemen wanted to work out a trade for his like-new Q2. That’s when I panicked.

I’ve been down this road before…twice. I sell an M and, after a short honeymoon with whatever replaced it, I miss it and want it back, so I sell something else and buy another.

So, I withdrew the listing. The fun part was that I’d boxed the camera up for sale and so it was like buying it again for the first time. Mmmm.

{{{img(/img/2022/20220630-box.jpg, Boxed and ready to re-open)}}}

{{{img(/img/2022/20220630-m10r.jpg, Ahh that's better)}}}

Remember: Never sell a Leica M or its lenses, because [[https://baty.net/2021/selling-cameras-is-usually-a-mistake/][selling cameras is usually a mistake]].

*UPDATE (July 17, 2022):* I've relisted the camera on [[https://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/1764823/0?keyword=Leica#15991578][fredmiranda.com]].

I rage-quit Emacs this morning. By that, I don’t mean that I hit C-x C-c really hard, although I did do that. I mean I stopped using Emacs.

#+hugo: more

I have spent so much time this past week futzing with my Emacs config. And then futzing with my note-taking process in Emacs. And then reading articles about how other people futz with these things. It occurred to me that I’ve not done much of anything else. So I quit.
Emacs is worse for me than other software because it’s too damn good at too many things. This sounds like a stupid reason to stop using Emacs, and it kind of is, but I need a break from living neck-deep in it. I need a change in venue.

What usually happens is that after a couple of weeks (sometimes days), I miss it. I miss that it does nearly everything and what it doesn’t do I can make it do, with just a few days of venturing down various rabbit holes. It’s those rabbit holes that get me. I’m trying to avoid that right now. And around it goes.

So, for now, I’ll edit text in BBEdit or (gasp!) Vim (an excuse to try the new v9). I’ll keep tasks in Things. I’ll write notes in TheBrain. Everything else I’ll just stop doing, I guess.

“But did you really quit?” you ask. I know, we’ve been here many times before. But yes, for the moment, I’m going to take a break from Emacs (and :sniff: Org-mode). I have to quit cold turkey or I just keep going back. Let’s see how long it lasts this time.

I was struggling with some recent tweaks to this blog's theme, and while poking around I discovered that the [[https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt][LoveIt theme]] was once again being developed. I had moved to the CodeIt theme after LoveIt looked to be abandoned back in 2020. The author had simply seemed to disappear. And then, a month ago, there was [[https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt/issues/672][this post]].

Since CodeIt was archived recently and development stopped, I took the opportunity to kill my fork and switch back to LoveIt. I cleaned up a bunch of unnecessary CSS while I was in there. I'm trying to stick as close as I can to the defaults for now.

I did need to re-integrate my [[/daily/][Daily posts]] section, but that wasn't too bad. Rather than fart around with forking the theme, I just overrode the layouts.

It's missing a few fancy tweaks and some font changes from the other theme, but it's less convoluted and hopefully less prone to falling apart when I'm not looking.

The quote from Robert Greene that I posted yesterday has thrown me a little:

#+begin_quote
[People] are far too present and familiar, their every move displayed on social media. That might make you relatable, but it also makes you seem just like everyone else.

Robert Greene
#+end_quote

I don't know how I feel about the idea that posting so much about myself makes me seem the same as everyone else. I always figured it showed how I was /different/. The very last thing I want to do is be just like everyone else.

I started writing daily notes [[https://wiki.baty.net][on my wiki]] as an alternative to spamming social media feeds with my every passing thought. I moved them to [[https://daily.baty.net][a separate blog]] because I thought that it was easier for normal people to read than the wiki. Then I [[/daily/][rolled them into baty.net]] and here we are.

But I sometimes worry that I share too much. I worry that there's nothing left to the imagination. I honestly don't know if this is a problem or not. I have days I want to burn it all down and [[https://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.html][pull a _why]].

#+begin_quote
I have a strong feeling that I will die young without artifact. That I will make no lasting impression. This will be my avenue. So hold your horsess I just have a few more things to do in life and I’m sure I’ll be out of your hair.

Why The Lucky Stiff
#+end_quote

How could I ever re-invent myself if the self everyone knows is the real one?

The answer is unclear. I share things because it's the best way I know of to be part of society without actually /being/ part of society. Sharing makes me feel known. It makes me feel like I exist. Writing on my blog rather than on social media feels like a different and better way to feel that way while still being different than everyone else.

I have no real intention of disappearing, but I am re-thinking what it means to be here.

You'll notice that I {{{mark(highlight short phrases)}}} in many of my daily post entries here. I think this makes it easier to scan things later. The HTML markup for this is just a styled =<mark>= tag wrapping the text to be highlighted.

I write my posts in Org-mode and convert them to Hugo-compatible Markdown using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]]. The path from Org-mode to HTML for this is a little convoluted, so I cheat and use a macro to generate the markup.

At the top of my blog.org file, I have defined the following macro:

=#+macro: mark @@html:<mark>$1</mark>@@=

And when writing posts in Org-mode, I surround the text I want to be highlighted with the macro, like this:

=I would like to {{{mark(higlight this text)}}} in the rendered HTML, please=

This replaces the text passed to the macro with properly-escaped markup for export. While it's easy enough to type the macro manually, I've created a small elisp function to do it for me:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jab/markregion ()
  "Add a 'mark' macro to the current region (for Hugo)"
  (interactive)
  (if (region-active-p)
      (progn
        (goto-char (region-end))
        (insert ")}}}")
        (goto-char (region-beginning))
        (insert "{{{mark("))))
#+end_src

Now, I can simply highlight some text and call the =jab/markregion= function and I'm done.

It's easier and faster than it sounds, really.

*UPDATE June 09, 2022*: This post was copied and pasted from the original WordPress post. Meta! :)

I’m typing this post in the WordPress editor. I don’t enjoy writing here unless I’m adding an image gallery or some other fancy embedded content. It just feels off. “So write in MarsEdit or Ulysses or something instead,” you implore.

#+hugo: more

Nah. I’ve tried that and decided that if I’m going to write in one place and publish somewhere else, I may as well just write in Emacs and publish a static website.

Speaking of static websites, this site was static just three weeks ago before I moved it to WordPress. It’s always a relief moving from a static blog to WordPress or Ghost. Everything becomes so easy! No futzing with rendering or deployment scripts. Images are just there, and properly sized and cached. Mmmm, good. But, easy doesn’t mean fun or nice. There’s no way around the fact that WordPress is big and a bit janky to work with. It may have everything one needs for maintaining a blog, but it also has everything one /might possibly ever need/. Those extra things inevitably get in the way and make the experience less fun.

There’s also the permanence issue. For example, my [[https://archive.baty.net/post/][20-year blog archive]] runs on a simple, static, cheap Digital Ocean droplet. I never think about hosting it. I don’t worry (as much) about security or patches or upgrades. It just sits there, idling, almost entirely on its own. And, I always have a rendered version locally, right next to the original Markdown (and Org mode) source files. Everything is managed in Git and backed up easily with a simple file copy. Everything is searchable and fungible locally. Everything is /fast/.

WordPress, while easy to host, needs to be watched closely and constantly. Things can break. Backups are more complex. Everything is more complex, really.

What it comes down to for me, I think, is that having a static website feels better to me. It feels /right/.

I love tinkering with different blog engines and methods. I’ll probably always switch between them. It’s fun! But for the long haul, and for peace of mind, I find that running a static site suits me better.

So I'm sorry if your RSS feed is pummeled with duplicates, but we've gone static again.

For years, I’ve kept a paper notebook at hand. I always have a Moleskine-style [[https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/bullet-journal-edition-2.html][bullet journal]] or a [[https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft][Field Notes pocket notebook]] or a [[https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/][Hobonichi Techo]] nearby. Sometimes all three.

Lately, I’ve been feeling hampered by keeping my journal on paper. My handwriting is terrible unless I write very slowly and deliberately. I worry that personal journaling suffers from too-slow, overly-deliberate writing. I spend too much time deciding between and playing with various writing instruments. I love my fountain pens, but I’m left-handed, and fountain pens are not ideal. The ink and paper must be just right, and that’s hard to arrange.

Eleven years ago I started using [[https://dayoneapp.com/][Day One]], a journaling app for macOS and iOS. Day One is a fantastic app, dedicated to journaling. I’ve used it intermittently ever since. I’m now using it all the time.

What this has meant is that I’ve been keeping a journal in both paper and digital formats. This doesn’t make sense.

I love (I mean, /love/) having the artifact of a paper journal. Just seeing all those filled notebooks lining my shelves is comforting. It may be comforting, but it’s not /useful/. I’m starting to feel like I need more usefulness in my tools.

Journaling offers different benefits to different people. For some, the simple act of writing down one’s thoughts is enough. I love that part of it. However, I also love searching for things my past self has written. Not /browsing/, searching. They’re different. Browsing old paper journals is a favorite pastime of mine, but more often it would be handy to be able to look for specific things I’d written. I could keep a detailed paper index, but I’m not even close to disciplined enough to maintain that. I’ve tried. It’s awful.

Being able to paste in texts or emails from family and friends is another bonus with digital journaling. Or quotes, or tweets. Sure, there’s a certain romance to transcribing quotes by hand, but in reality, I rarely do it.

And then there are images. I have a big Moleskine notebook that serves as both a journal and a photo album/scrapbook. It’s beautiful and, again, a wonderful physical artifact. But, I need to be in the right mood or it doesn’t get updated. Day One pulls photos in from my photo library and fits them nicely into the day’s entry. Hard to beat that kind of convenience.

As for artifacts, I print my digital Day One journal every month and put the pages into a binder. It’s not quite as lovely an artifact as a hand-written paper notebook, but it’s pretty good. And Day One lets me print a real book from entries, which I’ve started doing annually. The books might be even nicer than paper notebooks.

I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop writing in paper notebooks completely, but for the moment, most of my writing will be digital. I’ll pick up the notebook now and then and write a little. One thing I’ve learned is that no matter how infrequent the entries, the result is still valuable. This way, I’ll have most of my writing in a convenient digital format, backed up on paper. I’ll also have beautiful, timeless paper notebooks so that future generations can throw them away, unread.

Long story short, I have successfully rationalized the purchase of a new iPad Pro and keyboard.

After a week or more of non-stop tinkering with nearly every bit of software on my Mac, I had a fit and decided to switch things up. I now have an iPad Pro (11-inch) with Smart Keyboard. The idea is that the software I use on iOS is less prone to tweaking. Plus, I’m not always futzing with shell aliases and other CLI tools just for fun. I’m not tempted by a 32-inch screen peppered with windows just begging me to play with them. I’m still thinking Reset to Defaults.

I just want to read and write. Maybe doodle a little. And I want to do it digitally and on paper. Hence, the “hybrid” idea.

So I have a limited-capacity device alongside my paper notebooks and index cards. I took over the unused upstairs bedroom (which used to by my office anyway) and cleaned out everything I don’t need. This is the first iteration. I’d like to keep it minimal so I’m not adding things until I feel I need them.

A week ago I did that thing where I blow up my system because I noticed I’d been doing that other thing where I spend all my time tweaking everything.

I’m calling it an experiment, and I’m naming it “Reset to Defaults”.

The idea is to revert to stock macOS apps where feasible, or simple and established apps otherwise, and avoid tools that lend themselves to constant tweaking. This hurts because tweaking is what I spend much of my time doing. I enjoy it! But, it’s a distraction and I should do less of it. To this end, I’ve restructured task management, blogging, journaling, note-taking, photo editing, file management, etc.

Yesterday I wrote that I no longer wanted to talk about my process. Yet, here I am talking about my process. I’m doing it because this is what helps me sort things out and remember how they were sorted. So, what the hell, let’s make it a blog post.

Here’s what I’m trying.

*Apple Reminders* for task management. Reminders has gotten much better recently. There’s smart lists, tags, the works. It’s a very capable app and integrates with everything, so I’m trying it. This change has the highest chance of failure, because I don’t like Reminders. I don’t like how it feels or how it handles notes or how I need to click in a certain area to select things or that it adds a new reminder every time I simply click in an empty space below the list. Anyway, we’ll see. There’s a 50% chance I’ll be back in Things and a 25% chance I’ll be back in Org mode for my tasks.

*Apple Notes* for notes. What?! That’s right, I’m writing all my “evergreen” notes in Apple’s venerable Notes app. I have to say, Notes is really nice, once one lets go of “IT MUST BE MARKDOWN” or whatever. It doesn’t have to be Markdown, btw, if you’re not converting your writing to HTML or some other format. I have zero fear of lock-in and there are various methods of saving notes as text or other formats. I’m trying to get over wringing my hands about all that.

*Day One* for personal journaling. I have 3,671 entries in Day One going back to 2011. Each of them has location and weather info, along with date and time. Many have photos or other images. I can filter and export them any way I see fit, to text, Markdown, PDF, or HTML. I can order a nice printed book from any selection of entries. I can journal on my iPhone or iPad. I can hook it into other tools using the CLI if I want. And I spend almost no time tweaking it. I just type and save. Day One was my default journaling app for years and I’m going to try it again for a while.

Of course there are always a bunch of supporting players, and I’m evaluating how I use those too. For now, this feels like I’m using the tools that I would use if I didn’t think too hard about tooling. Let’s see what happens this time.

I just sold my wonderful Leica Q2 Monochrom. This was the second time I’ve owned a Q2M and the second time I’ve sold one.

The Q2M is a nearly perfect walk-around, everyday camera for someone who wants to focus purely on making black and white images. That describes me perfectly, for a while. I love B&W photographs and the Q2M makes them as good or better than anything available. I love how using a B&W-only sensor forces me to think in tones, shades, and lighting.

But, and there’s always a “but”, my use of the camera is mostly while hanging around with family or out at dinner, etc. As an everyday carry camera, I am often asked by family members if they could “see the color version” and they are disappointed when I tell them there is no such thing. After a while, I start to feel like I want the option to shoot black and white, but not always.

I also have a beautiful M10-R which is always just begging to be used. The decision about which camera to bring is crazy-making for me, so I now have fewer choices, which I am telling myself is a good thing.

My “kit” now consists of the Leica M10-R and Leica MP. It’s great being able to use the same lenses on both film and digital bodies. And there really is nothing that compares with an M.

{{{img(MPandM10R.jpg, Leica MP and Leica M10-R)}}}

The biggest gap this leaves is that I still need something for casual carry. Something with auto-focus and macro capabilities that I can shoot one-handed. The M cameras leave me without any of that and I often miss it. For now, I’m filling that gap with the little Ricoh GRIII. It’s a great, tiny, easily-pocketable camera that should do just fine.

I’ll miss the Q2M, but for now, I’m going to work with what I have, and what I have is pretty great. But don’t be surprised if a future post discusses something entirely different.

I've been using the Happy Hacking Professional 2 Keyboard [[https://archive.baty.net/2018/the-happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-2/][since 2018]]. After a long search and [[https://archive.baty.net/2019/ill-be-sticking-with-the-hhkb/][many]]  different [[https://archive.baty.net/2020/can-realforce-replace-hhkb/][dead ends]], I'd found the keyboard for me. I still think the HHKB is nearly perfect, but there's one problem.

#+hugo: more

The problem is that having to access the Function layer (for arrow keys, etc.) using my pinky is causing discomfort in my hand. On the one hand (pun!), I'm good at using the function key to access the arrow keys. They are close by so it's actually faster and easier than on keyboards with dedicated arrow keys. This took me a /long/ time to realize, but now that I'm used to it, other keyboards feel less efficient. But, on the other hand (again!), I don't enjoy the pain in my hand.

I'm going to reset for a bit and give the pinky a break. I'm taking the lazy way out and just using the Apple Magic Keyboard. The Apple keyboards are fine, and as a bonus, the layout matches the MacBook Pro keyboard so switching is less jarring. Still, it's a shame.

Here's my setup today. (Notice my poor HHKB cowering in the shadows.)

{{{img(R0002184.jpg)}}}

*UPDATE*: (24 hours later). I'd rather suffer the pain than not use the HHKB. It's back on my desk this morning.

I've had a pair of Apple's [[https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/][AirPods Max]] for almost exactly one year. The headphones


look nice and sound very good, but I don't enjoy using them. I've been thinking about why that is, and came up with the following list.

*There's no Off button*. I hate this. I don't use them every day, and if I don't remember to either plug them in or put them in the case (for "low power mode" or whatever it is), the batteries are often dead when I go to use them.

*They feel unstable on my head*. I can't figure out what it is about the way the AirPods Max fit, but I find that I'm always aware of them on my head and am constantly adjusting them. Maybe it's because of my giant head, but they aren't as comfortable as they should be.

*They steal audio from the AppleTV.* Occasionally, when my wife is doing a workout using the AppleTV in the next room,  I'll put on the AirPods, and they steal audio from the TV instead of connecting to my Mac, which is right in front of me. I haven't been able to figure out why this happens, but it bugs both of us.

*I  can't stand the clicking sound they make* when moving them around. If the AirPods are folded flat, they bang together when I pick them up and move them around. The sound is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. Why is nobody talking about this?

*The "case" is stupid*. Who approved that thing?

I wish I enjoyed them more. Spatial audio is nice, and the noise canceling works great. They sound really good, too. However, and as much as I hate wires, I find myself plugging in the [[https://en-us.sennheiser.com/high-quality-headphones-around-ear-audio-surround-hd-650][Sennheiser HD 650s]] most of the time instead. The 650s fit perfectly, sound even better, don't need charging, and never do anything wrong.

I have some pretty nice things. I'm fortunate and have more "stuff" than I could ever need. And yet, it seems as if I'm always buying something new. It's just that I like to try new things, whether it's tools, software, gadgets, or what have you. I want to see what different things feel like to have and use.

{{{img(Garage.jpg, My Dad's Garage - 2022)}}}


The photo above is from my dad's garage, taken this year. I took it because I'm always amazed at how little it changes. My dad rarely buys anything new. He just uses what he has.

Recently, I have been striving to be more like my dad. Whenever I start looking for some new thing to help me do some old thing, I say to myself, "Use what you have!" It's working pretty well. I have not purchased anything new if I already have something similar that will do the job. No gadgets, cameras, pens, notebooks, computers, etc. I already have all those things, and they work great.

I've kept a list of books I've read as a plain text (well, technically, Markdown) file for years. I wrote about it [[/2021/book-logging-in-plain-text-2/][here]]. The public version is rendered using Github Pages at [[https://books.baty.net][books.baty.net]].  This is fine, but at some point last year I also started logging books in an Org mode file, just to see how it felt. It felt pretty good!

The outline looks like this:

{{{img(Outline.png)}}}

That's fine, but doesn't show much information other than a short title. That's where Org's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-attributes.html][Column View]] comes in. Column view shows a summary of a set of headings in a customizable view. The setup for mine is this:

=#+columns: %50ITEM(Title) %author(Author) %pages(Pages){+} %8rating=

This sets columns, widths, titles, and even a total of the number of pages (via the ={+}= flag). Then, I have a block which generates and saves the column view for me. Here's that block.

#+begin_src org
,#+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id global :skip-empty-rows t :indent t :match "-noexport"
,#+END
#+end_src

Pressing =C-c C-c= on that block header generates a nice table view of my book attributes. Here's what the file looks like, including the column block:

{{{img(BooksDotOrg.png, My books.org file)}}}

I like it. It's like a little plain-text database.

I probably won’t bother backfilling it with earlier entries, but I plan to keep it updated from now on. I haven’t yet created any fancy org-mode “Capture templates” because let’s be honest, I don’t finish enough books to benefit from that kind of automation. I simply copy and paste an earlier entry and modify that. Maybe I’ll do something smarter at some point, just for fun.

Org mode is pretty great and can do just about anything.

**** DONE I need a new film scanner :@Photography:

My Epson V750 Pro, purchased in 2009, has scanned thousands of rolls of film, slides, and prints. After making strange grinding noises recently, it has finally ground to a halt.

#+hugo: more

Here are the last images it was able to scan from the most recent roll (2022-Roll-066)...

{{{img(Scan1.jpg, Self-portrait (2022))}}}

{{{img(Scan2.jpg, Alice (2022))}}}

So now what? I guess I need a new scanner. I have a PrimeFilm XAs but it's 35mm only and can be quite fidgety to use. And it only does 35mm. I need to scan 35mm, 120, and 4x5 negatives.

I am trying to decide between two options: A new flatbed Epson V850, or a digital camera scanning setup. I already have most of the doo-dads needed for digital camera scanning. I just don't have a feasible digital camera and macro lens up to the task.

I'm leaning toward the Epson V850 flatbed because I'm used to the workflow and, although expensive,  it would be cheaper than buying a new camera setup. On the other hand, I can use the new camera as, you know, a camera too, which would be nice.

It's just that I tried scanning with a digital camera before (Fuji X-T3) and didn't like what it did to the grain. I don't know that a higher-resolution camera and better macro lens would fix it.

What I might do is rent something like a Nikon Z7 and one of their macro lenses for a week and see if I like the results. The Nikon Z is probably what I'd look at if I were interested in a new mirrorless kit for general photography anyway.

I'll let you know how it goes.

[[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] is "A plain-text personal knowledge management system" using Emacs and Org-mode and I put nearly all my notes in there. While it's easy to find notes in org-roam based on filename, there's no obvious way to search the /contents/ of notes. Weird, right?

#+hugo: more

I could use the default =projectile= search, but my org-roam files live within my main ~/org directory, so the results are littered with all my other org documents. I'd prefer to only search in =~/org/roam=

I use a simple lisp function to help with this. It uses =consult-ripgrep=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jab/search-roam ()
 "Run consult-ripgrep on the org roam directory"
 (interactive)
 (consult-ripgrep org-roam-directory nil))
#+end_src

I added a keybinding for it to my other org-roam bindings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map!
 "\C-c n f" 'org-roam-node-find
 "s-u" 'org-roam-node-find
 "\C-c n i" 'org-roam-node-insert
 "\C-c n t" 'org-roam-dailies-goto-today
 "\C-c n d" 'org-roam-dailies-capture-today
 "\C-c n c" 'org-roam-capture
 "\C-c n s" 'jab/search-roam               ;; <-- my new keybinding
 "\C-c n l" 'org-roam-buffer-toggle)
#+end_src

Now, with a quick =C-s n s= I can search my org-roam files using the blazingly fast [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]].

If there's a better way to do this, I'm all ears.

The last time I rewatched "The West Wing" I was once again  impressed by how good people were at their jobs. How /productive/ everyone was. I wondered how /I/ could be that productive.

#+hugo: more

I noticed that the entire process used by the staff seemed to be carrying around folders full of paper and barking things like "Get me the file on senator Jones and the notes from our briefing!" Within minutes they would be perusing a bunch of photos and papers scattered about a desk and they'd develop a plan right then and there. Awesome!

So, I started organizing all of my projects in manilla folders. One folder per project. I called it the "West Wing Productivity System". I'd print meeting notes, mindmaps, emails, etc and put them in the appropriate folder. I kept a single summary sheet clipped to the inside with contact information, summary info, budgets,  etc.

Whenever I needed to work on a project, I'd grab the folder, spread its contents across my desk, and get to work. It was nice knowing where everything was. It was nice being able to see everything at once, if necessary. (I had a big desk).

On the other hand, it was a pain when I needed to share something with colleagues. Search kind of sucked. And if I happened to be at home without the proper folder in my bag I was screwed.

It was fun for a while, but this was nearly 10 years ago. I still use folders, just not quite so deliberately.
Just for the hell of it, I've brought back the system for some of my home projects. There's not a lot of risk and I get to shuffle papers around again like I'm Josh's assistant or something.

{{{img(McnallyPortrait.png, Photo by Joe McNally)}}}

There's no question that McNally is a talented photographer with a powerful work ethic and serious technical skills. His portraits, however, leave me uninspired. You know the style. Creatively lit with a handful of Speedlights, carefully arranged backgrounds or sets, wardrobe and makeup people, etc. The kinds of photos that get a shit ton of likes. This style is not for me.

Now, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Joy_Ross][Judith Joy Ross]], on the other hand, makes deeply moving, personal portraits while wandering around with an 8x10 view camera. I wasn't familiar with her work until recently. I mean, just look at these...

Now that I've moved my blog back to a static site generated with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]], I noticed that I was writing both my [[https://daily.baty.net][Daily notes]] and my blog posts in side-by-side Emacs buffers. It got me thinking about consolidating my sites even further.

#+hugo: more

The challenge was that I didn't want to simply shuffle the daily posts in with the "regular" posts. I wanted a "Daily" section. But, I also wanted today's Daily post to show on the home page, since that's where the action is.

I'm the first to admit the Hugo's templating system is a complete mystery to me. I've been using Hugo for /years/ and I still don't know what gets rendered where or how. I mostly just throw stuff at the wall until something sticks.

After several hours of Google and wild guesses, I've gotten it close enough to publish. You're soaking in it. The home page shows the most recent post in the =/daily/= folder. Then at [[https://baty.net/daily/][baty.net/daily/]] I show a reverse-chronological list of daily posts.

I've added a couple of tweaks. The list of Daily posts differs from the home page in that I display the full posts and not just the "summary". That was surprisingly difficult to wrangle.

I have a new attribute in the front matter, =weather=, which is displayed on daily posts. This lets me display the weather differently from the posts' content. The cool feature here is that I'm adding the weather attribute automatically when creating new posts. I create posts using YA Snippet, which can call custom functions at the time of expansion. Here's my "daily" snippet:

#+begin_src org
  # -*- mode: snippet -*-
  # name: Hugo Daily Post
  # key: daily
  # uuid: daily
  # --
  *** TODO ${1:title} :@Daily:
  :PROPERTIES:

  :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :weather "`(jab/insert-weather)`"
  :END:

  $0
#+end_src

Note the =:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :weather "`(jab/insert-weather)`"= property. I have a custom function called =jab/insert-weather= which calls the =wttr= service and outputs the current weather conditions. Surrounding the function with backticks causes the function to be evaluated while the snippet is expanded. Neat! Note that I also dynamically generate the filenames based on the current date.

This all means that, in my posts.org file, I can type =daily= and hit tab, enter the title, and I'm ready to publish.

I had lunch with my parents recently and took a few photos with both my film and digital cameras. I shot about the same number of photos with each camera, with close to the same number of "keepers". Which do I prefer?

#+hugo: more

Here I'm showing one of each, digital and film, of my favorite from the visit.

{{{img(MomFilm.jpg, Film: Leica MP (HP5 Plus))}}}

@@html:{{< figure src="MomDigital.jpg" caption="Digital: Leica M10-R (B&W conversion in Silver Efex)" >}}@@

I prefer the film image. I manipulated the digital shot in Silver Efex Pro and added a bit of grain to try and get the look I like, but I still prefer the film image.

The difference might be partially due to using the 50mm Summilux on the MP. It's my favorite lens. The digital shot was with the 35mm Summilux. Also a great lens, but lacks that certain "something" of the 50.

I don't think the lens difference explains it, though. A large part of what makes me prefer film photos is just /knowing/ they're film photos. That means something to me, and influences how I respond to an image. One could probably use a decent HP5 preset on that image in Lightroom and I wouldn't be able to tell it from a film photo in a blind test, but I don't view my images that way. I know how they were made, and it matters.

Additionally, I can make beautiful silver gelatin prints of the film photo in my darkroom. That's important, too.

I'll probably always shoot both film and digital, but more often than not I prefer the results I get from film.
